      <title>Miller, Susan - &#39;Genre as Social Action&#39;</title>
      <link>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/composition/miller-genre/</link>

      <guid>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/composition/miller-genre/</guid>
      <description>One Liner Genre is social action made of rhetorical and semiotic forms and substances which arise out of reoccurring social situations.
Summary Highlights how genres are a point of connection between intention and effect. This synthesis and analysis arouse out of an ethnomedological approach to genre. Genres arise out of recurrent social situations, and the social situations become a result of the genres. While they may include conventionalized responses to recurring social situations, they create the rhetorical situation, they don&amp;rsquo;t respond to it.</description>

      <guid>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/composition/devitt-genre/</guid>
      <description>One Liner Letting go of old notions of genre to better understand the roles that genres play in writing.
Summary Genre is a concept that is based not on the features of the text, but on the social, cultural, and contextual factors in which the texts emerge and in which they do work. Genres are not a passive form, but rather an active and dynamic force. Genres begin with a rhetorical situation, and expands to include semiotic situated social context.</description>

      <description>One Liner Changes in the nature of writing and the proliferation of composing outside the academy are creating a writing public that is digital, multimodal, and connected.
Summary There are tectonic shifts in literacy driven by the growth of a writing public, facilitated by technology. Our survival as a discipline (and growth into a discipline in other&amp;rsquo;s eyes) depends upon our embracing of technology and adapting what the role of rhetoric and composition is to understanding the composing in the world.</description>

      <guid>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/composition/faigley-material-literacy-visual-design/</guid>
      <description>One Liner Literacy has always been material, we are just more likely to notice it when computer technology brings it to our attention.
Summary Computer technologies bring the materiality of literacy to our attention in the ways in which it collapses false binaries such as Oral vs. Written. In doing so, he starts by tracing the paradox of alphabetic literacy and the narrative of its attempts to become transparent. He uses the examples of the greek alphabet and the gutenberg press and their attempts to hide or make transparent the materiality of language.</description>

      <description>One Liner Ecomcomposition works as a (literal) framework and subject area for composition theory and pedagogy.
Summary Ecocomposition is an approach that brings into conversation place, discourse, and environment in a meaningful theoretical frame for study, but also a pedagogical frame for the teaching of composition. Much of its potential works from the ability of ecocomposition to bring different ecological and composition practices and perspectives together while also working with environmental interconnectedness and how it is expressed through composition.</description>

      <description>One Liner Explores what constitutes a book in the age of digital scholarship.
Summary Present, in digital form, a type of scholarly edited collection that deals with what constitutes and counts as scholarship in composition. Through performing and presenting the chapters, the authors and editors theoretically explore the idea of the book and the work of writing in digital spaces while also bringing attention to the tools, technologies, and practices that go into the creation and distribution of scholarly work.</description>

      <title>Fleckenstein, Kristie S. &#39;Words Made Flesh: Fusing Imagery and Language in a Polymorphic Literacy.&#39;</title>
      <link>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/composition/fleckenstein-words-made-flesh/</link>

      <guid>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/composition/fleckenstein-words-made-flesh/</guid>
      <description>One Liner (Proposes? Explores) Polymorphic literacy that takes into account the many embodied, visual, and linguistic experiences that come together in composing.
Summary The image has been subordinated to language in composition theory. Fleckenstein explores the different types of images that are common to literate practice and explores relationships between images and words. The image is a temporal and spatial experience which serves as an anchor. A polymorphic literacy offers a bridge between word, image, and experience that can lead to praxis.</description>

      <description>One Liner We are in Paradigmatic shift in composition studies brought on by the work in cognition and process.
Summary Summarizes the idea of a paradigm shift and argues that R/C is in the middle of one due to the work being done in cognition and the process of writing. This work in the cognitive process of writing offers us research paradigm and a disciplinary content around which to organize research and teaching.</description>

      <guid>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/composition/johnson-eiola-and-selber/</guid>
      <description>One Liner Suggests that we should privilege problem solving in texts and writing over the creation of something original in composition.
Summary Suggest assemblage theory as a better means of approaching what composition is and what it can do. In framing composition as assemblage, and writing as problem solving, we have to rethink what plagiarism is and the role that it does or does not play in the privileging of certain types of writing and composing activities.</description>

      <description>One Liner &amp;ldquo;Writing is one of the activities by which we locate ourselves in the embedded systems that make up the social world,&amp;rdquo; in a way that is not just thinking but also acting
Summary Proposes an ecological perspective on composition and the teaching of composition which draws on educational psychology and linguistics, along with the work in cognitive process. It is a reaction to expressivism as well as cognitive process.</description>

      <guid>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/composition/cooper-rhetorical-agency/</guid>
      <description>One Liner Individual agency emerges from embodied processes, and is inescapable for embodied beings (443).
Summary Agency is an emergent quality rather than something that is a quality of the subject. With this view, we need to take careful consideration of the ethics and responsibility of using and approaching agency in writing and composition.
From Notes:
 Conscious and non-conscious control over agency Complex systems theory - expression of agency as a perturbation Agent are unique, embodied individuals Agency emerges from within interactions in the system  Serves as a bringing together of modern critical theory, post-modernism, and neuroscience.</description>

      <description>One Liner Bringing perspectives on activity theory into composition studies.
Summary Introduction Collection offers insights and investigations into the use of activity theory in composition studies. Bazerman and Russell see the two working well together theoretically due to accounting for the humanist perspectives, tools, technologies, activities, and mediations as they are constructed and expressed in writing. Writing is defined here as semiotic signs on a page (or interface) which mediate meanings between people within a context of activities in which people give meaning to texts.</description>

      <description>One Liner Ecological perspective as research methodology organizing research into circumferences for context.
Summary Taking an ecological perspective is important for research in composition because of the complex, messy, and contextual nature of writing itself. Working from Burke, and the ways in which metaphors structure and organize our view (screens) they think about the relationships between our research methods and our research questions. Effective and robust research metaphors that harmonize research with phenomenon.</description>

      <description>One Liner Traces instruction of composition in the 20th century to trace connections between rhetoric and epistemology.
Summary Traces writing instruction through the 20th century (specifically 1800-1985) in American Universities and generates a taxonomy of writing programs and instructional styles out of the survey. He groups writing instruction into three broad epistemological categories: subjective, objective, and transactional. Out of this historical tracing and typographical analysis, be names and classifieds the rhetoric of these different pedagogical, epistemological, and ideological approaches, and organizes them based on the relationships between the roles of rhetoric, epistemology, literacy, and ideology.</description>

      <description>One Liner The study of misunderstanding, working to understand them, and proposes rhetoric as the remedy.
Summary Pushes against traditional understandings of rhetoric as correctness, usage, and persuasion. Works with the aims of discourse, interinanimation of words, defintions, and metaphors to illustrate the purpose of discourse. Words themselves are just a part of the meaning, only know what they mean with other things around it.
Key Concepts  interinanimation of words - words work with one another in generative ways.</description>

      <description>One Liner Exploration of the epistemological and/or ontological basis for composition research methodologies.
Summary Uses the exploration of the field of composition as an emerging entintity surrounding the making of knowledge in the teaching and study of writing. This frame is used to define and explore different methodologies in composition and composition studies. North first traces the emergence of composition as a field, then the practices of inquiry and different theoretical approaches to composition.</description>

      <description>One Liner Argues for a contextualist paradigm which collapses the quantitative/qualitative dichotomy which is adapted to a variety of research situations informed by the type of knowledge we are inquiring into and the context in which it is housed.
Summary Seeks to bring clarity and direction to research in rhetoric and composition by re-examining scientistic approaches in rhetoric and composition. Starts by questioning the sense of a paradigm for Rhetoric and Composition.</description>

Summary Fulkerson looks back at his previous 2 articles summarizing the state of the emerging discipline to update and theorize the current state of composition theory. He sticks with axiology as the theoretical frame. He sees three overriding axiologies at work in current composition theory and pedagogy.</description>

      <description>One Liner Proposes that a disciplinary paradigm for a &amp;ldquo;full theory&amp;rdquo; of composition should include axiology, procedures, epistemology, and pedagogy.
Summary Proposes a &amp;ldquo;full theory&amp;rdquo; of composition out of the consensus of purpose that emerged during the 80s. Highlights the diversity of methodologies that he uncovered. Proposes that this theory would have 4 components:
 Axiology - what constitutes good writing. What is the aim of composition? What is the aim of good teaching in composition?</description>

      <description>One Liner Examines expressive, mimetic, rhetorical, and formalist philosophies of composition and their curricular and pedagogical implementation.
Summary Examines four philosophies for composition: expressive, mimetic, rhetorical, and formalist. Finds that many composition teachers either don&amp;rsquo;t have a consistent philosophy, or are unable to have their philosophy coherently influence and shape their pedagogy. That there is a dissonance between what teachers say they want to do and what they do. The article seeks coherence between philosophy and pedagogy, and assumptions about composition with curriculum.</description>

      <description>One Liner Process gives composition a research focus as a discipline, and we need to move from theory to critiquing why, how, and by whom writing is taught in American Universities.
Summary Process gives a disciplinary and research core to composition studies in relationship to English. Theories of process give R/C a paradigm which argues for disciplinary status in the academy. However, pursuing competing theories of process and their scholarship have left questions of ideology, power, and writing instruction unexamined and uncritiqued.</description>

      <description>One Liner Rhetoric as a distributed and inventive force, and delivery as techne provides different frames for examining rhetoric in motion and in action.
Summary Looks at delivery as techne, or a practical art. He takes this perspective to think about multiple audiences that would be interested in the delivery and circulation of digital texts: R/C scholars, humanists, human-computer interaction specialists and theorist, technical communications, web designers. The use of techne situates delivery at a moment of praxis, and provides a framework for digital delivery with the following five components:</description>

      <description>One Liner Cybrorgs a metaphor for reconstructing boundaries of politics, theory, materialism, and humanism across science and technology.
