      <description>One Liner The study of misunderstanding, working to understand them, and proposes rhetoric as the remedy.
Summary Pushes against traditional understandings of rhetoric as correctness, usage, and persuasion. Works with the aims of discourse, interinanimation of words, defintions, and metaphors to illustrate the purpose of discourse. Words themselves are just a part of the meaning, only know what they mean with other things around it.
Key Concepts  interinanimation of words - words work with one another in generative ways.</description>

      <description>One Liner Rhetoric as a distributed and inventive force, and delivery as techne provides different frames for examining rhetoric in motion and in action.
Summary Looks at delivery as techne, or a practical art. He takes this perspective to think about multiple audiences that would be interested in the delivery and circulation of digital texts: R/C scholars, humanists, human-computer interaction specialists and theorist, technical communications, web designers. The use of techne situates delivery at a moment of praxis, and provides a framework for digital delivery with the following five components:</description>

      <description>One Liner Uses discourse surrounding RAWA to examine the role of the circulation of digital texts in the transformation and appropriation of feminist discourse.
Summary Examines the circulation of digital textxs of RAWA and Afghan women to examine how digital circulation often &amp;ldquo;constructs and reinfomres binary oppositions and rhetoircs of superiority&amp;rdquo; (472). Uses RAWA and the construction and circulation of Afghan women&amp;rsquo;s stories to visualize and conceptualize the often invisible and transparent nature and processes of circulation of these texts.</description>

      <guid>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/rhetoric/banks/</guid>
      <description>One Liner The African American rhetorical tradition illustrates how text technologies are always already rhetorical, visual, mulitmodal, and racist.
Summary Using the African American and Black expeirence in light of technologies to explore and invite useful critics of African American rhetoric and digital rhetoric.

      <guid>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/rhetoric/delagrange/</guid>
      <description>One Liner Verbal and visual arragnemengt are inventive spaces, like a wunderkamen, which allow for epistemological discovery.
Summary Uses the wunderkamen as a metaphor for arrangment as a post-moden and feminist space for doing rhetorical work. Sees the state of not knowing, Aporia, as an important place to inhabit in approaching visual and spatial arragenment in the production of knowledge in-between creator (originator?) , audience, and text experience. Uses the arrangment and the wunderkamen to examine new media spaces, rather than just digital texts or just visual texts, as an important intersection.</description>

      <description>One Liner Remediates the canons and the trivium for new media with interfaces and ecologies.
Summary Sets up a framework for a rhetoric of new media where the unit of analysis is the interface, a place of mediated rhetorical practices that may span multiple texts.

      <description>One Liner Co-evolution and co-development of human and material through the idea of significant otherness.
Summary Uses the co-evolution o fdogs and human species to bring together a narrative of significant otherness that is not only written into our behavior and culture, but also into our genes. It is a next step, a development, from the cyborg manifesto in the enacting, unfolding, and emergent convergence over time. The human/dog companionships represents an implosion of nature and culture in a &amp;ldquo;relentlessly historically specific&amp;rdquo; way (18).</description>

      <guid>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/rhetoric/haraway-situated-knowledges/</guid>
      <description>One Liner Only partial perspectives offer objective vision, and feminist objectivity means situated knowledges.
Summary This piece pushes against relativism and totalization by offering a feminist objectivity of situated knowledges. This feminist standpoint theory interrogates universalization, objectivity, science, and formalization by illustrating their emergence from partial perspectives. The tools and technologies, the visions allowed by modern science, give us ways of seeing the the world that are not passive vision, they are shaped by particular perspectives that allow specific vision.</description>

      <description>One Liner Cybrorgs a metaphor for reconstructing boundaries of politics, theory, materialism, and humanism across science and technology.
Summary Big takeaway points:
 Production of totalizing and universal theory is a mistake that misses most of reality Taking responsibility for the social realities of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics. Means embracing the skillfull task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life.  The cyborg is a metaphor that is both organism and machine, physical and nonphysical, and ideal and material.</description>

When someone is brought to change through language use, they identify with the symbol user in some ways and are changed by it. He brings in the notion of consubstantiality as a means by which they are brought together.</description>

      <description>One Line Critiques, in a rather direct way, Bitzer&amp;rsquo;s rhetorical situation to argue that rhetoric creates situations rather than responding to them.
Summary Argues that exigences are created by the rhetor for/with the audience in the act of using language rhetorically. Rhetors create or invent rhetorical situations through their work. This creation of a reality is specific to the rhetorical sitaution and event that is created through the discourse of the rhetor.</description>

      <description>One-Line Works to articulate a framework for the rhetorical situation, and how discursive work is performed and realized.
Summary Useful in thinking about rhetoric and the rhetorical situation as something that exists out in the world that we respond to as rhetoricians and people. Sees the rhetorical situation as existing out in the world, and the rhetor responds to it appropriately and ethically. Not a rhetorical situation if its not acted upon by the rhetor to move the audience to action in response to the exigence.</description>
