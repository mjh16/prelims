      <description>One Liner Offers a historical approach to play and offers insights into play&amp;rsquo;s significance to the development of cultures.
Summary In approaching a history of play as a significant and defining aspect of human cultures, Huizinga starts by examining play as a naturally phenomenon that is more than just physiological or psychological. Play, he argues, is a significant and signifying activity that mediates understanding between people. Presents this as a play-concept&amp;ndash;a tension, mirth, and more than fun&amp;ndash;that can be examined in a variety of societal and cultural structures.</description>

      <description>One Liner Play is symbolized non-discursively within magic circles, and new media allows for play to be symbolized within new media objects.
Summary New media facilitates the symbolization of play within new media objects by allowing play within certain types of media within other media&amp;rsquo;s spaces. As a tool and a technology, new media blurs traditional boundaries between mediated spaces, and producers and consumers. Play, in this fashion, is an intrusion upon one media&amp;rsquo;s magic circle by another - a language and action of one actor upon another media.</description>

Presents a disenchantment with established spaces and a desire for new forms (pulled by new media), and that the scope of composition has become too narrow, even as it has become technologized.</description>

      <description>One Liner &amp;ldquo;Keen use of digital resources allows rhetoric scholars to focus on practices and see documents as important, but wrapped up with machines, bodies, expectations, and instruments in a &amp;lsquo;mangle&amp;rsquo; that makes science the messy work of managing the unknown, the impractical, and the unpredictable.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>One Liner Technology, and often digital technology, is not only important to our environment and how we interact with and within it, but it transforms our knowledge about self and the world.
