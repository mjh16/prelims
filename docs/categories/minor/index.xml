      <description>One Liner Threshold concepts can serve as a reflective frame in the development, administration, and implementation of a writing major.
Summary Threshold concepts are able to powerfully and intentionally organize writing majors in the ways in which they stabilize and name ideas and concepts that are important to the discipline. While they did not consciously utilize threshold concepts in their development and revision of the department and the major, on reflection and analysis they had structured many of their moves and hires.</description>

      <description>One Liner Where does creative nonfiction live in a professionally or discipline focused writing major?
Summary Where does creative nonfiction fit within the major? They suggest focusing on theoretical and conceptual issues as a field and a discipline. That unless we can define, as a discipline, theoretical and conceptual connections between creative nonfiction and rhetoric and composition this is an area for a potential schism now or in the future between the two.</description>

      <description>One Liner Proposes a socio-epistemic approach for the major that pushes towards an abandonment of the double-consciousness that separates learning about writing from the activity of writing.
Summary In this approach the major helps to push students, administrators, teachers, and institutions to abandon the double-consciousness that separates the learning about writing from the activity of writing. Major focus and work helps students to become specialists in the study of written language, rhetoric, writing technologies, and image/textual semiotics.</description>

      <description>One Liner Major/concentrations create and solidify a definition of what writing is.

Notes how change is slow within institutional structures and large fields/disciplines. Brings to attention issues of what writing is and what its relationship to rhetoric and composition. Also brings into question the role of creative writing. Issues of academic turf.</description>

      <description>One Liner Argues that shape is an important consideration when designing majors with attention to technology.
Summary Thinks shape is especially important with the writing majors when there is a overt consideration of technology&amp;rsquo;s effects on writing.

Uses, Thoughts, and Connections Nope, not convinced.</description>

      <description>Summary Major is a driver of &amp;lsquo;why&amp;rsquo; to be excited about rhetoric and composition. Moved to Canada for the major. Helps to forge new potentials across contexts for rhetoric and composition. The major also brings attention to the enthocentricism of rhetoric and composition as it is a deeply and distinctly American program.
Uses, Thoughts, and Connections Reflection and connection piece. Interesting to think of in response to others and as an example in itself</description>

      <description>One Liner The development of a writing major challenges traditional views and assumptions of writing and writing instruction.
Summary &amp;ldquo;The process of establishing a writing major can challenge the traditional normative vision of writing instruction and offer in its stead a representation of writing as a discipline and its instruction as part of the intellectual work of the institution&amp;rdquo; (42). Discusses the context of the popular myth/image of the composition/writing and its instructors as remedial (and of literacy work more generally) and as only a service/skills course that is presented to the University.</description>

      <description>One Liner Present a heuristic based on Chronos and Kairos to examine the development of Elon&amp;rsquo;s writing concentration.
Summary Use their experiences in the development of the program at Elon to walk through the questioning process that they underwent in the development of their concentration. These are questions that get at local context and needs.

      <description>One Liner The development of writing majors is fundamentally changing our disciplinary relationship to English and the humanities.
Summary Writing majors have the potential to influence disciplines which we share academic homes and intellectual neighborhoods. Those specifically mentioned are literature, humanities, philosophy, etc. This is due to similar interest in the theoretical construction of these different disciplines. Rhetoric and composition already often include undergraduates in theoretical and empirical research work, this can be extended to the major as well, with implications for other disciplines, and includes involvement and encouragement of research which is typically reserved from graduate students.</description>

      <description>One Liner Marxist and labor based analysis of the major and the discipline that encourages a deeper understanding of the connections between what we do in the writing classroom and the institutional means by which it is done.
Summary &amp;ldquo;Writing majors will need to be developed mindful of how current instituional practices already shape the ongoing concerns and work of the field&amp;rdquo; (88). Tony Scott argues that by examining the curriculum of writing classrooms, and then writing majors, we can examine how the material relations of power that exist through the classroom.</description>
