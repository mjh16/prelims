      <description>One Liner Proposes the cyborg as the embodiment of posthuman transhistorical practices that navigates rhetorical moments according to the occasion.
Summary Argues for the image of the cyborg as an [in]tense third-sophistic rhetoric that moves beyond the New Rhetorics as occasioned by political atmospheres and realities. This third-sophistic cyborg is embedded in postmodern and posthuman rhetoric. Considers the third sophistic as being emboldened and defined by an understanding of mÃªtis that embodies postmodern rhetorical practice.</description>

      <description>One Liner Brings together Foucault&amp;rsquo;s author function with Bawarshi&amp;rsquo;s genre function to articulate the multiple frames of being for scholarly webtexts and their readers/users.
Summary Exams scholarly webtexts composed by Anne Frances Wysocki, Charles Lowe, and Collin Gifford Brooke as representative of a range of approaches to new media and multimodal production. Explores how Foucault&amp;rsquo;s author function and Bawarshi&amp;rsquo;s genre function reflect the values of computers and writing. Largely reads across the texts to argue that when texts are digitized they author-function operates in multiple and uneven ways.</description>

      <description>One Liner Complicates the individualistic and atomistic view of invention by arguing for a wider lens that takes into account social language and culture, social histories, and a history of ideas.
Summary Usefully expands what invention is, situating it as a social process that an individual plays a role in, and an important role, but not the only role. Proposes the view of invention as a social act that questions a view of invention as a motion of discover or recovery of existing knowledge.</description>
