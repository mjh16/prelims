      <description>One Liner Proses a theory of distributed invention in which two or more people engage in proximal composing and sharing of ideas, where collaboration becomes a site of mutual appropriation and evolution.
Summary Uses the experience of sharing a room at DMAC, and working on projects, to highlight the ways in which working near someone creates new inventional potentials and possibilities. Explores the spatial nature of invention, and the ways in which the intentional and unintentional arranging of people and materials in places facilitate different kinds of invention.</description>
