      <description>One Liner Defines invention as providing guidance into beginning writing, exploring ideas and arguments, framing insights, and examining writing situations and that it occurs within specific cultural, social, and historical contexts.
Summary Examines the history of invention in rhetoric and composition through two broad frames. The first covers issues in invention from classical through the mid-20th century, and the second from the mid-20th to ~2000. IN doing so, Lauer explores the difference between a classical view of invention, through the enlightenment, and finally in 20th century views, connections between theories of invention and classroom practice.</description>

      <description>One Liner Present a heuristic based on Chronos and Kairos to examine the development of Elon&amp;rsquo;s writing concentration.
Summary Use their experiences in the development of the program at Elon to walk through the questioning process that they underwent in the development of their concentration. These are questions that get at local context and needs. They recommend starting with this heuristic inventory to theorize a coherent program identity to then chart development pff of the pairs of perspectives on time: chronos and kairos.</description>
