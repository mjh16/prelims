      <description>One Liner Composition has been viewed as something that American Universities do, and has often been offered as a conscious to meet those expectations and assumptions.
Summary Uses ASU and its transformations from a normal school, to a teachers college, and then a university to argue about the place of composition and the role of FYC. Argues that FYC is something that colleges and universities do. He examines the change of English 1 and 2 to English 101&amp;frasl;102 as Arizona State developed from a Arizona Normal School into Arizona Teacher&amp;rsquo;s College (and eventually ASU) from an institutional perspective to argue about the roll of FYC and composition and professionalization more broadly.</description>
