      <description>One Liner Proposes a history of rhetoric with a reframed techne which radically redefines individualism and contextualizing speech acts.
Summary Finds feminist projects which work to include and write women speakers into the history of rhetoric as another cultural move to highlight certain voices while silencing others. That it still works as cultural gatekeeping, even if more voices are included. Argues that this system of canonization puts emphasis on the individual subject as originator of works, and including women is a start, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t challenge the underlying logic and ideology of canon formation.</description>
