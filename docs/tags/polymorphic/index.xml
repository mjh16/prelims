      <description>One Liner (Proposes? Explores) Polymorphic literacy that takes into account the many embodied, visual, and linguistic experiences that come together in composing.
Summary The image has been subordinated to language in composition theory. Fleckenstein explores the different types of images that are common to literate practice and explores relationships between images and words. The image is a temporal and spatial experience which serves as an anchor. A polymorphic literacy offers a bridge between word, image, and experience that can lead to praxis.</description>
