      <description>One Liner We should reconsider English Composition and the spaces in which it occurs as experimental and happening, and that composition is a necessary place for radical exploration of what it means to be language using and social beings.
Summary That in an effort to become a discipline, composition because sterile and institutional and has come to reflect those spaces in theory and pedagogy. Presents a disenchantment with established spaces and a desire for new forms (pulled by new media), and that the scope of composition has become too narrow, even as it has become technologized.</description>
