      <description>One Liner Technology, and often digital technology, is not only important to our environment and how we interact with and within it, but it transforms our knowledge about self and the world.
Summary Claims that rhetoric must diffuse outward to include the material environment, things, our own embodiment, and a complex understanding of ecological relationally as participating in rhetorical practices and their theorization.
To do so we must recognize ambience as molding materiality and the environmental properties with human design become integral together to the whole feeling and thought of a piece/artifact/experience.</description>

      <description>One Liner Individual agency emerges from embodied processes, and is inescapable for embodied beings (443).
Summary Agency is an emergent quality rather than something that is a quality of the subject. With this view, we need to take careful consideration of the ethics and responsibility of using and approaching agency in writing and composition.
From Notes:
 Conscious and non-conscious control over agency Complex systems theory - expression of agency as a perturbation Agent are unique, embodied individuals Agency emerges from within interactions in the system  Serves as a bringing together of modern critical theory, post-modernism, and neuroscience.</description>
