      <description>One Liner Proposes the cyborg as the embodiment of posthuman transhistorical practices that navigates rhetorical moments according to the occasion.
Summary Argues for the image of the cyborg as an [in]tense third-sophistic rhetoric that moves beyond the New Rhetorics as occasioned by political atmospheres and realities. This third-sophistic cyborg is embedded in postmodern and posthuman rhetoric. Considers the third sophistic as being emboldened and defined by an understanding of mÃªtis that embodies postmodern rhetorical practice.</description>

      <description>One Liner Rhetoric as a distributed and inventive force, and delivery as techne provides different frames for examining rhetoric in motion and in action.
Summary Looks at delivery as techne, or a practical art. He takes this perspective to think about multiple audiences that would be interested in the delivery and circulation of digital texts: R/C scholars, humanists, human-computer interaction specialists and theorist, technical communications, web designers. The use of techne situates delivery at a moment of praxis, and provides a framework for digital delivery with the following five components:</description>

      <description>One Liner Co-evolution and co-development of human and material through the idea of significant otherness.
Summary Uses the co-evolution o fdogs and human species to bring together a narrative of significant otherness that is not only written into our behavior and culture, but also into our genes. It is a next step, a development, from the cyborg manifesto in the enacting, unfolding, and emergent convergence over time. The human/dog companionships represents an implosion of nature and culture in a &amp;ldquo;relentlessly historically specific&amp;rdquo; way (18).</description>

      <description>One Liner Cybrorgs a metaphor for reconstructing boundaries of politics, theory, materialism, and humanism across science and technology.
Summary Big takeaway points:
 Production of totalizing and universal theory is a mistake that misses most of reality Taking responsibility for the social realities of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics. Means embracing the skillfull task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life.  The cyborg is a metaphor that is both organism and machine, physical and nonphysical, and ideal and material.</description>
