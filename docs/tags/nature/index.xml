      <description>One Liner Offers a historical approach to play and offers insights into play&amp;rsquo;s significance to the development of cultures.
Summary In approaching a history of play as a significant and defining aspect of human cultures, Huizinga starts by examining play as a naturally phenomenon that is more than just physiological or psychological. Play, he argues, is a significant and signifying activity that mediates understanding between people. Presents this as a play-concept&amp;ndash;a tension, mirth, and more than fun&amp;ndash;that can be examined in a variety of societal and cultural structures.</description>
