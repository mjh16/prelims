      <description>One Liner Genre is social action made of rhetorical and semiotic forms and substances which arise out of reoccurring social situations.
Summary Highlights how genres are a point of connection between intention and effect. This synthesis and analysis arouse out of an ethnomedological approach to genre. Genres arise out of recurrent social situations, and the social situations become a result of the genres. While they may include conventionalized responses to recurring social situations, they create the rhetorical situation, they don&amp;rsquo;t respond to it.</description>

      <title>Johnson-Eilola, Johnson, and Stuart Selber. “Plagiarism, Originality, Assemblage”</title>
      <link>https://michaelhealy.space/prelims/posts/composition/johnson-eiola-and-selber/</link>

      <description>One Liner Suggests that we should privilege problem solving in texts and writing over the creation of something original in composition.
Summary Suggest assemblage theory as a better means of approaching what composition is and what it can do. In framing composition as assemblage, and writing as problem solving, we have to rethink what plagiarism is and the role that it does or does not play in the privileging of certain types of writing and composing activities.</description>

      <description>One Liner Individual agency emerges from embodied processes, and is inescapable for embodied beings (443).
Summary Agency is an emergent quality rather than something that is a quality of the subject. With this view, we need to take careful consideration of the ethics and responsibility of using and approaching agency in writing and composition.
From Notes:
 Conscious and non-conscious control over agency Complex systems theory - expression of agency as a perturbation Agent are unique, embodied individuals Agency emerges from within interactions in the system  Serves as a bringing together of modern critical theory, post-modernism, and neuroscience.</description>

      <description>One Liner Ecological perspective as research methodology organizing research into circumferences for context.

Key Concepts  interinanimation of words - words work with one another in generative ways.</description>

      <description>One Liner Cybrorgs a metaphor for reconstructing boundaries of politics, theory, materialism, and humanism across science and technology.
Summary Big takeaway points:
 Production of totalizing and universal theory is a mistake that misses most of reality Taking responsibility for the social realities of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics. Means embracing the skillfull task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life.  The cyborg is a metaphor that is both organism and machine, physical and nonphysical, and ideal and material.</description>

      <description>One Liner Language creates ways of seeing reality through obscuring and highlighting reality.
Summary The terms we use allow us to see certain things about the action/situation/event while obscuring other things from view or possiblity. Terms select what we can and cannot see/understand by directing that attention towards certain actions or understandings and away from others. It allows certain things through. They are tied to systems, and the relationships between language and the system.</description>

Consigny returns to the topoi to theorize how rhetorical situations constrain, allow, and create the the opportunity for rhetoric in a variety of different ways.</description>
