      <description>One Liner Proposes a theory of expertise in writing as a organizational theory for advanced composition.
Summary This article seeks to define and explore a theory of expertise as an organizing theory for advanced composition as something that is distinct and different from First-Year Composition. Sees advanced composition as potentially and ideally offering something more than just more of the same with FYC. Defines expertise as a movement from behavior that is governed by general principles, processes, and strategies, to behavior that is governed by specialized knowledge.</description>
