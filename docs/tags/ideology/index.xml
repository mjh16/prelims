      <description>One Liner Examines expressive, mimetic, rhetorical, and formalist philosophies of composition and their curricular and pedagogical implementation.
Summary Examines four philosophies for composition: expressive, mimetic, rhetorical, and formalist. Finds that many composition teachers either don&amp;rsquo;t have a consistent philosophy, or are unable to have their philosophy coherently influence and shape their pedagogy. That there is a dissonance between what teachers say they want to do and what they do. The article seeks coherence between philosophy and pedagogy, and assumptions about composition with curriculum.</description>

      <description>One Liner That in societies, language is controlled by various overt and subvert, conscious and subconscious, restrictions and forces in order to control its power as it becomes discourse.
Summary Foucault&amp;rsquo;s summary of his project: &amp;ldquo;I am suggesting that in every society the production of discourse is at once controlled, selected, organized, and redistributed according to a certain number of procedures whose role is to avert its powers and its dangers, to cope with chance events, to evade its ponderous, awesome materiality.</description>

      <description>One Liner Illustrates how oratorical culture in 19th century America represents a transformation to a distinctly American ideology resting on the knowledge of the individual, that informs the pedagogy, practice, and theory of contemporary rhetoric.
Summary Uses transformation as a historiographic trope to construct views of the past that acknowledge changes, loses, and gains, and can be useful in seeing the connections to current moments as well as to explore it in context.</description>
