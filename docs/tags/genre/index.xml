      <description>One Liner Genre is social action made of rhetorical and semiotic forms and substances which arise out of reoccurring social situations.
Summary Highlights how genres are a point of connection between intention and effect. This synthesis and analysis arouse out of an ethnomedological approach to genre. Genres arise out of recurrent social situations, and the social situations become a result of the genres. While they may include conventionalized responses to recurring social situations, they create the rhetorical situation, they don&amp;rsquo;t respond to it.</description>

      <description>One Liner Letting go of old notions of genre to better understand the roles that genres play in writing.
Summary Genre is a concept that is based not on the features of the text, but on the social, cultural, and contextual factors in which the texts emerge and in which they do work. Genres are not a passive form, but rather an active and dynamic force. Genres begin with a rhetorical situation, and expands to include semiotic situated social context.</description>

      <description>One Liner Bringing perspectives on activity theory into composition studies.
Summary Introduction Collection offers insights and investigations into the use of activity theory in composition studies. Bazerman and Russell see the two working well together theoretically due to accounting for the humanist perspectives, tools, technologies, activities, and mediations as they are constructed and expressed in writing. Writing is defined here as semiotic signs on a page (or interface) which mediate meanings between people within a context of activities in which people give meaning to texts.</description>

      <description>One Liner Looks back over previous work to elide three axiologies at work in current composition theory: critical/cultural studies, expressivism, and procedural rhetoric.
Summary Fulkerson looks back at his previous 2 articles summarizing the state of the emerging discipline to update and theorize the current state of composition theory. He sticks with axiology as the theoretical frame. He sees three overriding axiologies at work in current composition theory and pedagogy.</description>

      <description>One Liner Stakes a middle ground between Vatz and Bitzer where rhetoric is an art that poses a possible solution to where two sides seem to be in conflict.
Summary Rhetoric is the art (think Techne) of facilitating resolution and probabilities/possiblities out of situations of conflict. Rhetoric can create a resolution or create one. Consigny returns to the topoi to theorize how rhetorical situations constrain, allow, and create the the opportunity for rhetoric in a variety of different ways.</description>
