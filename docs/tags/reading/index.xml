      <description>One Liner Brings together Foucault&amp;rsquo;s author function with Bawarshi&amp;rsquo;s genre function to articulate the multiple frames of being for scholarly webtexts and their readers/users.
Summary Exams scholarly webtexts composed by Anne Frances Wysocki, Charles Lowe, and Collin Gifford Brooke as representative of a range of approaches to new media and multimodal production. Explores how Foucault&amp;rsquo;s author function and Bawarshi&amp;rsquo;s genre function reflect the values of computers and writing. Largely reads across the texts to argue that when texts are digitized they author-function operates in multiple and uneven ways.</description>
