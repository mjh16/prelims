      <description>One Liner Using surveys and document collection, provide a snapshot of the undergraduate writing major around 2010.
Summary Responding to the CCC&amp;rsquo;s committee on the major, they outline the growth of the undergraduate writing major. They map the growth of the major in English departments and independent writing departments as a valuable and growing set of work being done by Rhetoric and Composition. They find that there are two main types of writing majors: liberal arts writing and professional/rhetorical writing.</description>
