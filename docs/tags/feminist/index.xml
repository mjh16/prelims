      <description>One Liner Examines the modernist view of the solitary writer writing alone in order to form a new scene of writing based on imagination and the tensions in the scene of writer-reader-text.
Summary Looks at the modernist conception of writing&amp;ndash;an individual, writing alone, in service of the writing, often male, as an observer or traveler in the world of others&amp;ndash;and its roots within the literary conceptions of the author. Illustrates this view and examines the ways in which it is disruptive to the composition classroom due to its weight in shaping the scenes in which we and students imagine as where writing occurs.</description>

      <description>One Liner Proposes the cyborg as the embodiment of posthuman transhistorical practices that navigates rhetorical moments according to the occasion.
Summary Argues for the image of the cyborg as an [in]tense third-sophistic rhetoric that moves beyond the New Rhetorics as occasioned by political atmospheres and realities. This third-sophistic cyborg is embedded in postmodern and posthuman rhetoric. Considers the third sophistic as being emboldened and defined by an understanding of mÃªtis that embodies postmodern rhetorical practice.</description>

      <description>One Liner Verbal and visual arragnemengt are inventive spaces, like a wunderkamen, which allow for epistemological discovery.
Summary Uses the wunderkamen as a metaphor for arrangment as a post-moden and feminist space for doing rhetorical work. Sees the state of not knowing, Aporia, as an important place to inhabit in approaching visual and spatial arragenment in the production of knowledge in-between creator (originator?) , audience, and text experience. Uses the arrangment and the wunderkamen to examine new media spaces, rather than just digital texts or just visual texts, as an important intersection.</description>
