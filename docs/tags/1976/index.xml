      <description>One Liner Imagination brings order to sense images through the production of mental images out of perceptions, which can allow thought to be applied to objects in the world.
Summary Traces a thread of imagination through time and to education. Works to connect imagination to the commonplace perceptual experiences to interpretations of those perceptions. This connection comes about through the creation of mental images. Connects this thread of imagination through philosophy and literature, spending time with the romantics, artists, philosophers, and educators.</description>
