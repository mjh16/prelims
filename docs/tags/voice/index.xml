      <description>One Liner Explores voice, in five different forms, in writing as something that is chosen and enacted as well as an authentic individual experience in writing to present voice as a practical tool with careful considerations.
Summary In the introduction to this collection, first explores three major debates about voice&amp;ndash;discourse as text vs. voice, ethos as virtue/appearance of virtue, self vs. role, &amp;ndash;. He then responds to these debates by illustrating how they don&amp;rsquo;t need to be resolved in either/or binary terms, and that a careful consideration of voice has some useful and noncontroversial applications when applied to writing.</description>
