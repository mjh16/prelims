      <description>One Liner Mechanical reproduction changes the material nature of works as the audience identifies with the reproduced work, not the original.
Summary A critical and cultural critique, that has at its core the criticism of fascist propaganda and the ways in which it gained and held power. Proposes that mechanical reproduction is a difference in kind for art (and for rhetoric), as it shifts the location of meaning from the original art-in-context to that of identifying with the medium as having meaning.</description>
