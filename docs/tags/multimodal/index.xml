      <description>One Liner Changes in the nature of writing and the proliferation of composing outside the academy are creating a writing public that is digital, multimodal, and connected.
Summary There are tectonic shifts in literacy driven by the growth of a writing public, facilitated by technology. Our survival as a discipline (and growth into a discipline in other&amp;rsquo;s eyes) depends upon our embracing of technology and adapting what the role of rhetoric and composition is to understanding the composing in the world.</description>

      <description>One Liner Literacy has always been material, we are just more likely to notice it when computer technology brings it to our attention.
Summary Computer technologies bring the materiality of literacy to our attention in the ways in which it collapses false binaries such as Oral vs. Written. In doing so, he starts by tracing the paradox of alphabetic literacy and the narrative of its attempts to become transparent. He uses the examples of the greek alphabet and the gutenberg press and their attempts to hide or make transparent the materiality of language.</description>
