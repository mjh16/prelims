      <description>One Liner Examines the modernist view of the solitary writer writing alone in order to form a new scene of writing based on imagination and the tensions in the scene of writer-reader-text.
Summary Looks at the modernist conception of writing&amp;ndash;an individual, writing alone, in service of the writing, often male, as an observer or traveler in the world of others&amp;ndash;and its roots within the literary conceptions of the author. Illustrates this view and examines the ways in which it is disruptive to the composition classroom due to its weight in shaping the scenes in which we and students imagine as where writing occurs.</description>

      <description>One Liner Ecomcomposition works as a (literal) framework and subject area for composition theory and pedagogy.
Summary Ecocomposition is an approach that brings into conversation place, discourse, and environment in a meaningful theoretical frame for study, but also a pedagogical frame for the teaching of composition. Much of its potential works from the ability of ecocomposition to bring different ecological and composition practices and perspectives together while also working with environmental interconnectedness and how it is expressed through composition.</description>

      <description>One Liner The study of misunderstanding, working to understand them, and proposes rhetoric as the remedy through metaphor.
Summary Pushes against traditional understandings of rhetoric as correctness, usage, and persuasion. Works with the aims of discourse, interinanimation of words, definitions, and metaphors to illustrate the purpose of discourse. Words themselves are just a part of the meaning, only know what they mean with other things around it.
Key Concepts  interinanimation of words - words work with one another in generative ways.</description>

      <description>One Liner Outlines the radical genre of women&amp;rsquo;s liberatory rhetoric with the oxymoron as its metaphor, that highlights the interactions between the personal and the political.
Summary &amp;ldquo;The rhetoric of women&amp;rsquo;s liberation is a distinctive genre because it envinces unique rhetorical qualities that are a fusion of substantive and stylistic features&amp;rdquo; (75). Out of this, argues that the substantive differences arise out of a demand for equality that is at odds with cultural values that deem social status based on sex at birth with democratic ideals.</description>
