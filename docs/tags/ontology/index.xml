      <description>One Liner Co-evolution and co-development of human and material through the idea of significant otherness.
Summary Uses the co-evolution o fdogs and human species to bring together a narrative of significant otherness that is not only written into our behavior and culture, but also into our genes. It is a next step, a development, from the cyborg manifesto in the enacting, unfolding, and emergent convergence over time. The human/dog companionships represents an implosion of nature and culture in a &amp;ldquo;relentlessly historically specific&amp;rdquo; way (18).</description>

      <description>One Liner Only partial perspectives offer objective vision, and feminist objectivity means situated knowledges.
Summary This piece pushes against relativism and totalization by offering a feminist objectivity of situated knowledges. This feminist standpoint theory interrogates universalization, objectivity, science, and formalization by illustrating their emergence from partial perspectives. The tools and technologies, the visions allowed by modern science, give us ways of seeing the the world that are not passive vision, they are shaped by particular perspectives that allow specific vision.</description>
