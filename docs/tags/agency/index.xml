      <description>One Liner Individual agency emerges from embodied processes, and is inescapable for embodied beings (443).
Summary Agency is an emergent quality rather than something that is a quality of the subject. With this view, we need to take careful consideration of the ethics and responsibility of using and approaching agency in writing and composition.
From Notes:
 Conscious and non-conscious control over agency Complex systems theory - expression of agency as a perturbation Agent are unique, embodied individuals Agency emerges from within interactions in the system  Serves as a bringing together of modern critical theory, post-modernism, and neuroscience.</description>

      <description>One Liner Grammar gives us the language, rules, and terminology for analysis of how language and thought become action.
Summary This piece introduces the pentad, the dramatistic perspective, and the ratios between aspects of the pentad. It proposes how shifting analysis of the ratios of the pentad will let us see how thought and language become action. It is specifically a grammar in that it is an attempt to mark the rules of the operation to describe how the pieces are put together.</description>
