### One Liner
Uses discourse surrounding RAWA to examine the role of the circulation of digital texts in the transformation and appropriation of feminist discourse.

### Summary
Examines the circulation of digital textxs of RAWA and Afghan women to examine how digital circulation often "constructs and reinforces binary oppositions and rhetoircs of superiority" (472). Uses RAWA and the construction and circulation of Afghan women's stories to visualize and conceptualize the often invisible and transparent nature and processes of circulation of these texts. See the political and the rhetorical.

Proposes global fields of rhetorical action to describe these circulations, and as more accurate basis for circulation than spatial or networked metaphors. The forces within the fields that texts passthrough reshape the meaning as they circulate, and to examine digital texts as a series of evolving rhetorical actions emerge from and circulating through many different contexts (475). Proposes a methodology of rhetorical genealogy to trace back history and relationships of circulated digital texts.

Traces RAWA and the uses and circulations of their website, images, and narratives to trace the field through which their representations became rhetorical action. However, as they circulated further, creates an overriding presence for particular representations and authorities which overrule others. Uses the example of the Miller letter and its circulation through various cyberfields to trace the genealogy of its changes. Uses these examples to argue for a careful transnational feminist activism that pays attention toe the ways in which ideologies are mediated across various fields.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Feels like it could work with New Materialisms fairly well. Interesting to think about in therms of rhetorical activism. The idea of fields, and the notions of pulls and gravity, is useful to think about with circulation.
