### One Liner
The African American rhetorical tradition illustrates how text technologies are always already rhetorical, visual, mulitmodal, and racist.

### Summary
Using the African American and Black expeirence in light of technologies to explore and invite useful critics of African American rhetoric and digital rhetoric. Able to look at not just what was being said (and its effectiveness) but also examine how. This dual perspective in the history of technology and rhetoric provides different avenues for examining the African American experience. The history of African American rhetoric is one of speakers learning, subverting, and manipulating the tools and technologies available to them.

Frames the digital divide as a rhetorical and technological problem. The African American tradition is as much about the privaledging of cultural development and contribution, as well as an awareness of the impacts of technology, and the deficits of its absence, in changing the overall situation. Additionally, African American rhetorics have a long tradition of being visual, verbal, performative, and multimodal. Examines specifically MLK Jr. and Malcolm X to illustrate how they effectively used technology and rhetoric in the civil rights movement for the advancement of African American concerns and equity. Uses these examples to show how an examination of technology, such as TV, to take control of the technology and to craft a space.

Goes into concerns of access, both with technology and with rhetoric, through the digital divide, to highlight the conservative and racist assumptions that often underly new tehcnologies, and the ways in which African American's have subverted them. There is a real divide and exlusion not only in who can gain access to digital technology, but also in the assumptions that underly it.
