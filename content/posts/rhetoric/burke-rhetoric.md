### One Liner
Shifts rhetoric from being about persuasion through language to identification through symbolic action.

### Summary
Uses and explores identification and how it operates in human communication and action. Proposes the identification is a better descriptor of what happens when rhetoric is used in symbolic action. When someone is brought to change through language use, they identify with the symbol user in some ways and are changed by it. He brings in the notion of consubstantiality as a means by which they are brought together. To identify with means to become one with, through symbolic action. They are brought together but are not the same. It is again a frame of analysis that is brought to bear upon how symbolic action functions. It puts the terms from the grammar of motives into use through the grammar.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
A lot here that is also covered in other places. In shifting rhetoric from persuasion to identification, Burke provides us a means through which language and symbol use can do other sorts of work. It provides potential inroads for thinking of rhetoric as epistemological. A view of the action of motives and dramatism.
