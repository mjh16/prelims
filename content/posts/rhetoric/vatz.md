### One Line
Critiques, in a rather direct way, Bitzer's rhetorical situation to argue that rhetoric *creates* situations rather than responding to them.

### Summary
Argues that exigences are created by the rhetor for/with the audience in the act of using language rhetorically. Rhetors create or invent rhetorical situations through their work. This creation of a reality is specific to the rhetorical sitaution and event that is created through the discourse of the rhetor. A rhetorical situation is more like a rhetorical event.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Can be used in tracing the changes of a thought. Also useful in thinking of the inventiveness and creation of rhetorical situations. It has to be to be rhetorical, it doesn't have the be a fiting response to going out into the wild and finding situations. It also can be "failed" and still be rhetoric (I think). *Would like to return to this soon*
