## One Liner
Mechanical reproduction changes the material nature of works as the audience identifies with the reproduced work, not the original.

## Summary
A critical and cultural critique, that has at its core the criticism of fascist propaganda and the ways in which it gained and held power. Proposes that mechanical reproduction is a difference in kind for art (and for rhetoric), as it shifts the location of meaning from the original art-in-context to that of identifying with the medium as having meaning. Works to describe the power of mass media in modern culture, we replace in the reproduction the aura of the original as an audience, but it is also a blindness to the separation from the art and the reproduction. Mass media, and especially photographic media (and one could argue digital media) do allow for a different type of sight, and a different type of criticism. This, however, does lead to a widening and wider gap between mass culture and critical views.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Circulation and rhetoric. Mass media and rhetoric. Has some useful implications and synthesis for visual rhetoric and digital rhetoric. What does it mean when our primary modes of communication are mediated.
