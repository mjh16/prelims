Sets philosophy and dialectic as the response to rhetoric, and that while rhetoirc has its place and its value it is limited in scope and should be used judiciously and appropriately. Concerned with defining rhetoric, its relationship to knowledge, and its value. Also concerned with "bad rhetors" and how people who use rhetoric should be prepared to do so.
