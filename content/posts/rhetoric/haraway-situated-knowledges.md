### One Liner
Only partial perspectives offer objective vision, and feminist objectivity means situated knowledges.

### Summary
This piece pushes against relativism and totalization by offering a feminist objectivity of situated knowledges. This feminist standpoint theory interrogates universalization, objectivity, science, and formalization by illustrating their emergence from partial perspectives. The tools and technologies, the visions allowed by modern science, give us ways of seeing the the world that are not passive vision, they are shaped by particular perspectives that allow specific vision. Vision is a move of power and ideology, in who sees and who is seen.

The search for full and totalized, universal positions is a myth. Positioning, therefore, "is the key practice in grounding knowledge oraginzed around the imagery of vision, as much Western scientific and philosophic discoursed is" (587).

"I am arguing for politics and epistemologies of location, position, and situating, where partiality and not universality is the condition of being heard to mekae rational knowledge claims" (589). That no knowledge is universal and that there is not a non-subjective "objective vision." That all knowledge is situated, and it is necessary to acknowledge and work from that. The world is an active agent and subject within knowledge making and scientiific pursuits, and has a unique agency in relationship to the human actors. Boundaries between objects of knoweldge and human(material and semiotic) entities are important and political and ideological. Objectivity is not about seperating, but about joining, intersections. 

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Connections to Burke and terministic screens for sure. Also, useful in thinking about subjectivity, where knowledge resides. Very useful in thinking about the post-modern and feminist relationships of rhetoric to reality, and in housing and viewing as it emerges and is enacted. Also useful in thinking about the power of vision and subject positioning in approaching ontology and epistemology.
