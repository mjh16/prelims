### One Liner
Cybrorgs a metaphor for reconstructing boundaries of politics, theory, materialism, and humanism across science and technology.

### Summary
Big takeaway points:

1. Production of totalizing and universal theory is a mistake that misses most of reality
2. Taking responsibility for the social realities of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics. Means embracing the skillfull task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life.

The cyborg is a metaphor that is both organism and machine, physical and nonphysical, and ideal and material. It is an embodiement which moves beyond binaries with ethical responsibilities that cross each. The cyborg is a creature of politics, materiality, economics, science, culture, and technology. It is a socialist-feminst approach and metaphor that brings together politics and economics with the self and the collective. Points out the "leaky distinctions" between human/animal, human/machien, and ontology/epistemology, and works to break the binaries and move beyond dualism and dualistic thinking.

This cyborgian blending and approach is a way of pointing out patriachal positions and issues, and to work to disrupt them productively.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
It is a theorization of a subject position, and a powerful one at that. Postmodern identity that is social, political, feminist, and technological.
