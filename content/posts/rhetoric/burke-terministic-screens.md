### One Liner
Language creates ways of seeing reality through obscuring and highlighting reality.

### Summary
The terms we use allow us to see certain things about the action/situation/event while obscuring other things from view or possiblity. Terms select what we can and cannot see/understand by directing that attention towards certain actions or understandings and away from others. It allows certain things through. They are tied to systems, and the relationships between language and the system.

These terministic screens are dramatistic instead of scientistic. The terms we use have a relationship to reality and how we form relationships to reality. Screens are socially constructed and give us ways in dramatic action to see certain parts of the system.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Offers a useful way of seeing how the gramamar/rhetoric function in the world. The terms we use give us one particular way of seeing and knowing some phenomemenon, and by changing the terms we can see different things. Perspective, subjectivity, standpoint, knowledge, and language all matter. Contextually driven.
