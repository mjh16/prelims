### One Liner
Grammar gives us the language, rules, and terminology for analysis of how language and thought become action.

### Summary
This piece introduces the pentad, the dramatistic perspective, and the ratios between aspects of the pentad. It proposes how shifting analysis of the ratios of the pentad will let us see how thought and language become action. It is specifically a grammar in that it is an attempt to mark the rules of the operation to describe how the pieces are put together. The grammar offers different ways to analyze and stabilize the system in ways that would otherwise be ambiguous. Burke defines language as modes of action that are transformative, and uses the pentad to analyze and approach these motions and actions.

Intentionally focuses on language rather than reality. The aspects of the grammar and the pentad are intrinsically linked to one another, and the grammar merely stabilizes for analysis. In action the parts are wrapped and influenced by each other in a set of ratios between the different aspects of the pentad. It is a dynamic system. The different aspects of the pentad are associated with one another and have a fundamental relationship in order for action/motives to take place.

The terms themselves have a substrate, or base structure (marxist?) that underlies their relationships with one another. This substrate sets the relationships for dramatistic action. The substrate is in the nature and substance of the terms. Substance modifies and allows for motivations, and combine in multiple ways within one definition of the pentad and motivate it in different ways. Substance and substrate is often hidden and only revealed through analysis and scrutiny.

The terms operate within certain scopes and reductions, they have a circumference of what we see. There are certain motivations that have such a strong power--such as love, knowledge, and authority--that it is overwhelming to the pentad/situation. These motivations are variously embedded within the situation and the pentad, are expressions of power, and can be revealed through analysis.

#### Dramatistic Pentad

- Scene - Where the action takes place? When does it take place? What is the context?
  - Possibilities and potentialities. Also constraints.
- Act - Action, what happens?
- Agent - Who, what the people who are situated with influence within the act?
- Agency - Instruments or mechanisms - how do the agents act?
- Purpose - Why do the agents act? What do they want?

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Ok, if I'm going to use or talk about Burke, this piece is really useful in thinking about the terms themselves, and the ways in which language describes and motivates. It offers a useful framework for examining something as it has unfolded. A analytical stance. Also useful in combination with other analytical pieces.
