## One Liner
Illustrates how oratorical culture in 19th century America represents a transformation to a distinctly American ideology resting on the knowledge of the individual, that informs the pedagogy, practice, and theory of contemporary rhetoric.

## Summary
Uses transformation as a historiographic trope to construct views of the past that acknowledge changes, loses, and gains, and can be useful in seeing the connections to current moments as well as to explore it in context. Doesn't privilege one view over another. They outline the transformation of an oratorical culture from one of neoclassicism to a more organically American synthesis. This transformation is represented in a bringing together of Neo-Ciceronian rhetoric with Lockean and Cartesian epistemologies that moved authority from institutions to individuals.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Historiographic approach. Useful as a starting place to show shifts to and from individual and institutional power and positioning.
