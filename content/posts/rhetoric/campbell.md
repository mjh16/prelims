### One Liner
Outlines the radical genre of women's liberatory, rhetoric with the oxymoron as its metaphor, that highlights the interactions between the personal and the political.

### Summary
"The rhetoric of women's liberation is a distinctive genre because it envinces unique *rhetorical* qualities that are a fusion of substantive and stylistic features" (75). Out of this, argues that the substantive differences arise out of a demand for equality that is at odds with cultural values that deem social status based on sex at birth with democratic ideals. Women's and feminists movements point out the consequences and implications of a culture that then appear revolutionary. The stylistic features of this genre include an invitation of participation from the reader, consciousness raising, structural solutions, and strategies designed to subvert and complicate the structure of reality. Highlight the intersections of the personal and the political. Because of this, the metaphor for women's radical rhetoric is the oxymoron. This does not figure with traditional notions of persuasion as it arises out of private contexts, by marginalized people, so as to become a rhetoric without a rhetor.
