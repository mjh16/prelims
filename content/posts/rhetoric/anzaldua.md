### One Liner
Inhabits and offers for our experience a way of navigating borderlands through a mestiza consciousness.

### Summary
Presents a way of being and navigating in the world that exists beyond and between linguistic and cultural boundaries and exists in the borderlands. Presents this consciousness as a physical place in the Rio Grande valley of her experience. As a gendered place it is between the expectations of man and woman, and the roles within that. As a socio-cultural space, that of language, immigration, between worlds. It is a means of navigating between people and places, and finding spaces to act. There is a crafting of a new consciousness and subjectivity that is aware of these inbetweens and responsive to them. It's not a part of set binaries, but a fluid consciousness that morphs and adapts, that is always changing. That to stablize offers some ways of seeing, but changes what it is by observation.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Useful in liminal spaces, of thinking how to productively bring things out of the inbetween. Also a useful place to think about subjective positions and the creation of them as a crafting of a place to speak from, of making the discourse in order to share the compelled nature of language. A bringing forth from many into one.
