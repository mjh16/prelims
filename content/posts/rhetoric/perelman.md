### One Liner
Rhetoric is the primary way of understanding language using systems.

### Summary
Examines the relationship of rhetoric to Philosophy and dialectic. Works with ideas of probable knowledge and argumentation, and extends this system to other language using practices due to the ways in which audience make meaning through language use. This system is very audience driven, and pays close attention to the ways in which audiences make meaning from the language that is presented to them. Audiences make meaning, and rhetoric is performed, through the adherence of the audience to provisional maxims, morals, and ethics. This is done by bringing presence to certain things and away from others. Works with different notions of the audience, universal and particular, which are important for attempting adherence through rhetoric and language. Theory of argument and argumentation that works its way back to rhetoric as a whole out of this analysis.

Drawn out of a philosophical argument and analysis. Argumentation (x-xi introduction):
1. Proceeds informally
2. Addressed to audience
3. Premises are acceptable to audiences
4. Ideas and values given presence
5. Ambiguity is unavoidable as language is interpretation
6. Typology of techniques
  - Quasi-logical - follow formal logic
  - Structure of reality (cause and effect more or less)
  - Examples, illustrations, or models
  - Analogy or metaphor
  - Dissociation
  - Amplification
  - Order


### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
A useful means of approaching and analyzing argumentation and rhetoric. Rhetoric is any place where consensus or agreement needs to be made through language, so it plays a role with any language system, and where non-formalized thought is concerned. Need to first establish a place within language to then move to other systems and thought. It is concerned specifically with language based argumentation and approaches. Could be useful to extend to other symbolic systems, but unsure.
