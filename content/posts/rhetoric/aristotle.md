## One Liner
Rhetoric is the art of finding, in any given case, the available means of persuasion.

## Summary
Produces a system of rhetoric that can be used for its study and its teaching. Focuses on rhetoric as an art, or techne (a practical art, skill that is learned), and techne in rhetoric involves recognizing and acting on the available means of persuasion. For Aristotle, rhetoric is the art of persuasion, and presupposes that rhetoric occurs within specific locations and contexts in society. He provides taxonomies of rhetoric and how it is used. His system of rhetoric emphasizes logical appeals, through enthymeme, example, and maxim, above other appeals. This approach to rhetoric highlights the importance of learning and natural skill. It also rests upon probable knowledge and careful observation of the world. Also sets up understandings of time and approach for rhetoric (context and speaker).

This system is an approach to teaching others rhetoric, how to use rhetoric, the ethical uses of, systems of building, and the hierarchy of relationships within the system of rhetoric. It builds, whenever possible, from the specifics of the audience in front of the speaker. It privileges a careful and close study of the situation and rhetoric as an object. Systemized study - leads to the canons although he doesn't mention them.
