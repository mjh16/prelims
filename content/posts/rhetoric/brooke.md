### One Liner
Remediates the canons and the trivium for new media with interfaces and ecologies.

### Summary
Sets up a framework for a rhetoric of new media where the unit of analysis is the interface, a place of mediated rhetorical practices that may span multiple texts. He then sets up what a rhetoric that attends to these interfaces may look like, using the trivium and the canons, as a framework for the relationships present in the interface. The framework is ecological , with the trivium as scales of activity that focus our attention in different ways. Sees the framework as useful for interrogating and producing new media texts.

#### Ch 1 - Interface
Proposes the interfaces as the location for new media production and criticism. Works to situate it as a mediated in-between, and remediated in a way that is seperate from Bolter and Gruisin. The interface is dynamic emerging and ongoing process. Traditional texts--articles, essay, and books--are also interfaces, however they are more stable ones. This is a shift in perspective.

#### Ch 2 - Ecology
Turn to the canons as an ecology to "construct a rhetoric that will allow us to both understand and produce interfaces" (27). Goes through the work of reclaiming the canons, and those who have done so first, situating the canons in a contemporary understanding of rhetoric, illustrating a rich understanding of how all 5 canons are understood in theory. Then he refigures the canons as an ecology that is central to R/C as a discipline. Proposes the canons as an ecology of practice that focus on "the strategies and tactics that we bring to bear on new media at the same time that our technologies constrain and empower us" (41). Proposes using the trivium (grammar, rhetoirc, dialectic/logic) reframed as code, practice, and culture, as units of scales or analysis. Proposes these as a structure to help triangulate analysis and production.

#### The Re-terms Ch. 3-7
1. Proairesis = Invention - introduces a distinction between hermeneutic and proairetic invention (from Barthes) as a means of contending with invention and the interface. Argues that new media invention in proairetic in its opening up of possibilities and teasing out of potentials rather than a closing off reading.
2. Pattern = Arrangement - re-understand arrangment as a pattern that is recognizable on different levels. Looks at acts of patterning--collections, tag clouds, etc--and looks a thte assumptions within these arragnments and the ways in which they work as code, practice, and cutlure.
3. Perspective = Style - proposes looking opening up style to more ecologies of practice to break it from the "grammar of visuals" that has dominated scholarship (his critique 114). Thinking of the interface and perspecitve, gives frames of analysis and prodiction *at/through* alongside *from* with the concern of new media.
4. Persistence = memory - think of data not only as teh storage of data (and the construction of data storage technolgies), but also as the construction of patterns. Tools and technologies allow for a *persistence of cognition* (144), on which we can perceive a thinking from a progression of thoughts (think visuals and how film makes motoin). Conceeds that there is a lot still to be done here.
5. Performance = delivery - Rethinking of delivery as performance, that avoids treating texts and interfaces as only static and discrete objects, but as involved in ongoing unfolding at relevance making. Useful to think of delivery and performance in new media as both transative and intransative, and to use both perspectives.

#### Coda - A conclusion of sorts
The book serves as an articulation of practices and perspectives that may be turned towards new media and used in new media scholarship as a heuristic approach, and one that can be reproduced effectively across different interfaces and new media practices.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Trivium as scales of activity - hmm, activity theory, assemblage knobs? Gets a bit heavy handed with making everything fit at times. Obvious connections to Delagrange and others in digital rhetoric. There is something here that is useful in thinking about texts as interfaces, and the myriad relationships that then go on around, in, through, beside, and with them.
