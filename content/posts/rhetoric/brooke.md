### One Liner
Remediates the canons and the trivium for new media with interfaces and ecologies.

### Summary
Sets up a framework for a rhetoric of new media where the unit of analysis is the interface, a place of mediated rhetorical practices that may span multiple texts. He then sets up what a rhetoric that attends to these interfaces may look like, using the trivium and the canons, as a framework for the relationships present in the interface. The framework is ecological , with the trivium as scales of activity that focus our attention in different ways. Sees the framework as useful for interrogating and producing new media texts.

#### Ch 1 - Interface
Proposes the interfaces as the location for new media production and criticism. Works to situate it as a mediated in-between, and remediated in a way that is seperate from Bolter and Gruisin. The interface is dynamic emerging and ongoing process. Traditional texts--articles, essay, and books--are also interfaces, however they are more stable ones. This is a shift in perspective.

#### Ch 2 - Ecology
Turn to the canons as an ecology to "construct a rhetoric that will allow us to both understand and produce interfaces" (27). 

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Trivium as scales of activity - hmm, activity theory, assemblage knobs? Gets a bit heavy handed with making everything fit at times.
