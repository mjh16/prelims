### One Liner
"Man is the symbol-using (symbol-making, symbol-misusing) animal, inventor of the negative (or moralized by the negative), separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy (or moved by the sense of order), and rotten with perfection"

### Summary
Definitions have a great power in describing and giving boundaries for understanding, and provides a way of both seeing what something is, and insight into what it is. The definition of man here explores the realtionships between reality and language. The defnition gives ways of thinking about people, their language use, and the relationships to reality. Each clause is explored in the relationship to language and the ways in which man makes knoweldge within the world.

- Symbol-using (making and misusing) - condense, substituied, and displace reality into symbols and language - borrows from Freud and otehrs here. It is transcendant in so far that symbols substitute, move beyond, the thing named. It is not that thing.
- Inventor of the negative - Can recognize and name a negative, an absence, a no. Able to put things into opposition with each other, wirk with antithesis. It is a type of irony, a "not that" of a cultural definition
- Sperated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making - defining self is a defining aspect of man. Use tools and technologies to create reality(ies?) seperate from natural condition.
- Goaded by the psirit of hierarchy - likes to put things into order. Put and pit things against one another in a wanting to make something of them. Order and class into societies and cultures.
- Rotten with perfection - culturally constructued ideals that are bound up with the language that seperates them from nature. Man wants to "reach for perfection" while also kept from, or unable to achieve due to differences between symbolic expectation, action, and outcome/reality.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
This feels very dated, and a place from which to potentially spring other things from. Also, makes a lot of assumptions about the nature of knowledge. Can be used as a place from which other things can spring, especially in terms of other theories. Feels like Burke, as a whole, is a place from which many other things sprign forth.
