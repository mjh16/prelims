### One Liner
Verbal and visual arrangement are inventive spaces, like a wunderkamen, which allow for epistemological discovery.

### Summary
Uses the wunderkamen as a metaphor for arrangement as a post-modern and feminist space for doing rhetorical work. Sees the state of not knowing, Aporia, as an important place to inhabit in approaching visual and spatial arrangement in the production of knowledge in-between creator (originator?) , audience, and text experience. Uses the arrangement and the wunderkamen to examine *new media* spaces, rather than just digital texts or just visual texts, as an important intersection.

New media texts, and hypermedia, force us to look at and look through the medium, and the interface, of the work to engage with the content. It's not just what it says, but also how it says it. There exists within a textual artifact a range of experiences and meanings, and numerous intersections between agents, bodies, and meanings within textual encounters and experiences. The wunderkamen offers a techne of invention and inquiry that is engaged with the mediated experience. The links, juxtapositions, and arrangement of new media and hypermedia have epistemological potential through their encouragement of reflective inquiry and generative ambiguity.

The builders of wunderkamen and hypermedia (new media) share four recursive and repeatable activities:

1. Collecting - collaborative work of gathering materials and ideas.
2. Arranging - arranging and re-arranging to see the multiple potentials. An aspect of play and inquiry. A process and work of juxtapositions. Cognitively and intentionally working to see what is occurring. A moment of aporia, of not knowing, where or what might emerge.
3. Reflecting - Step back and ask critical questions to see what connections, questions, knowledge, or actions emerge. Exploration of the relationships created.
4. Displaying - Opening up the spaces and pathways for others. Turning the wunderkamen or new media text over to a view/experiencing public and letting them immerse themselves and emerge with new potentials.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Very clearly fits in many of the same ways as the Porter piece, useful in reframing heuristically. Also a way to see how digital and new media rhetoric can encourage aporia and a holding off of judgement of pieces. Useful to think about the process of rhetorical emergence, and to frame rhetoric not as produces but as inhabitations. Nice to think about the places and pathways of rhetoric, and how many and different multiple subjects and bodies encounter media as potentially rhetorical. Offers a theory for generative exploration of new media and digital rhetoric as different types of rhetorical experiences and explorations.
