### One-Line
Articulates a framework for rhetorical situations where a rhetor produces a fitting response to an exigence that emergences in the world in order to alter reality through discourse.

### Summary
Useful in thinking about rhetoric and the rhetorical situation as something that exists out in the world that we respond to as rhetoricians and people. Sees the rhetorical situation as existing out in the world, and the rhetor responds to it appropriately and ethically. Not a rhetorical situation if its not acted upon by the rhetor to move the audience to action in response to the exigence. Many potential rhetorical situations arise and are not responded to, or are not responded to effectively.

It's largely a rhetor driven rhetoric which focuses upon the ability to respond to the exigence. It provides new insight by moving from a focus in rhetoric on style and delivery to action through the rhetor. Additionally, it moves rhetoric towards being a discipline by moving from style into the ways in which rhetoric reflects reality. Still reactionary, doing rhetoric for an audience in response to an exigence.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
A way to think about how a rhetor does work through a rhetorical situation. Requires a rhetor that is aware of and recognizes a situation. Rhetoric is situational, and requires the action of an audience in order to have occurred. Explores a *type* of discourse and language use that is tied to situations. Feels Aristotlean with a nice mix of modernism. Seems more concerns with "an in-time" rhetoric and the timing/Kairos of response.
