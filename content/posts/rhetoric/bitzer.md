### Summary
Keywords and concepts:
- Exigence
- Constraints
- Audience

Useful in thinking about rhetoric and the rhetorical situation as something that exists out in the world that we respond to as rhetoricians and people. Sees the rhetorical situation as existing out in the world, and the rhetor responds to it appropriately and ethically. Not a rhetorical situation if its not acted upon by the rhetor to move the audience to action in response to the exigence. Many potential rhetorical situations arise and are not responded to, or are not responded to effectively.

It's largely a rhetor driven rhetoric which focuses upon the ability to respond to the exigence. It provides new insight by moving from a focus in rhetoric on style and delivery to action through the rhetor. Additionally, it moves rhetoric towards being a discipline by moving from style into the ways in which rhetoric reflects reality. Still reactionary, doing rhetoric for an audience in response to an exigence.
