### One Liner
Stakes a middle ground between Vatz and Bitzer where rhetoric is an art that poses a possible solution to where two sides seem to be in conflict.

### Summary
Rhetoric is the art (think Techne) of facilitating resolution and probabilities/possiblities out of situations of conflict. Rhetoric can create a resolution or create one. Consigny returns to the topoi to theorize how rhetorical situations constrain, allow, and create the the opportunity for rhetoric in a variety of different ways. An exigence and rhetoric can exist in many different times and spaces. Through knowing and working with many different topics they can respond appropriately through experience and knowing. Within any given rhetorical situation that can be a variety of ways in which to respond. Brings together prior knowledge and emergent situations to theorize the multiplicity of rhetorical situations. Also recasts a typological and heuristic approach to rhetoric.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
This offers a framework that is both responsive and adaptive. Useful to think about genre and the recognition of situatins as being emergent and enacted, novel and familiar. It also can be useful in providing a means of rhetorical education. Topoi offer a potentially pedagogical approach to rhetoric as teachable and learnable. Rhetoric as a heuristic art, makes knowledge and claims about the world through questioning. Useful as a topic, tool, and realm of rhetoric.
