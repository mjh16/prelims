### One Liner
Visual arguments are of a different type, argue person into a "state of feeling."

### Summary
Assemble a theory of visual argumentation that is different from verbal persuasion. It expands the typical notions and troubles what have been the traditional distinctions between persuasion and argument. In building their theory of visual argument, the refute arguments that visuals cannot be arguments, and illustrate how visuals can be not only persuasive, and arguments. Illustrates how visual meaning, while it may be arbitrary, vague, and ambiguous, so can words, and visuals can powerfully offer other types of arguments that lead towards certain conclusions. Issues of interpretation are just as valid for verbal arguments.

Verbal and visual arguments are not the equivalent or identical, but both are persuasive. Like words, visuals also must be understood in context, for both analysis and production, to see how they are visually persuasive and argumentative. In adding context, sequence, and culture together extend the idea of the enthymeme. Additionally, visual culture offers broad design narratives that are also understood by producers and viewers, and that work on levels of resemblance and representation towards arguments.

A theory of visual argument should identify how we can: (318)

1. Identify the internal elements of a visual image
2. understand the context in which images are interpreted
3. establish the consistency of an interpretation of the visual
4. chart changes in visual perceptive over time

Call for further fleshing out of theories of visual argument that are as rich and rigorous as those for verbal. Offers an interdisciplinary location for inquiry and study.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Visuals already do rhetorical work, they do them in these ways, and therefore visuals can be arguments. Extends notions of persuasion to argument and illustrates how they can operate in visuals.
