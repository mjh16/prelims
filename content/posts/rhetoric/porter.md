### One Liner
Rhetoric as a distributed and inventive force, and delivery as techne provides different frames for examining rhetoric in motion and in action.

### Summary
Looks at delivery as techne, or a practical art. He takes this perspective to think about multiple audiences that would be interested in the delivery and circulation of digital texts: R/C scholars, humanists, human-computer interaction specialists and theorist, technical communications, web designers. The use of techne situates delivery at a moment of praxis, and provides a framework for digital delivery with the following five components:

1. Body/Identity - online representation of bodies and identities and their performance - How are they represented? How are they choosing to self represent?
2. Distribution/Circulation - technological concerns - How is it facilitated? What is the interface? What are the condition by which a text can do work?
3. Access/Accessibility - audiences connectedness and literacy - Who can access? Do they have the means to engage?
4. Interaction - Range and types of interactions that are facilitated by the text
5. Economics - What are the copyrights, owenership, and control issues. Who owns, who thinks they own, who subverts?

Thinks of each of these are topoi to stage heuristic inquiry into different areas of circulation. The focus being on being better and morea aware writer/designers as we think about and compose digital texts (and anylze them).

Recovers delivery as a powerful rhetorical framework for digital rhetoric because of the rapid and multiple circulation and distribution of rhetorical and potentially rhetorical artifacts in online and digital spaces. Gives us a way to think about what a "text" does once it moves from the originator out into the world.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Useful in thinking about what texts do, what people do, and how the various overlapping interactions make sense (or not) within digital circulation. Has a useful connections back to classical rhetoric and how it is brought together with action and bodies. Has a nice interweaving of praxis, and could be useful as a bridge between lots of different concepts in digtial rhetoric. Also tends to feel dated, based on the what of technologies that he is refering to and working with.

Also brings in some useful social and cultural critique.

Usefully reframes rhetoric and the rhetorical situation to start from audience concerns and working backwards from there. What does *this text, this artifact, this design* **DO** for *this particular, or these imagined audiences.*

Digital rhetoric and delivery help us to see and work within various rhetorical intersections.
