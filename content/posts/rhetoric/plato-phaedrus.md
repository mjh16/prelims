### One Liner
Phaedrus and Socrates wax poetic about love, and discover the truth about rhetoric and its pursuit of Truth along the way.

### Summary
Uses the occassion of Lysias's written speech, in a dialogue between Phaedrus and Socrates, to discuss the nature of discourse and language. Discuss what the role of rhetoric is by examining, revising, discussing, reading, and creating speeches in inspiration of this one. Also considers the differences between written language and oral language are different. Portability, timelessness, not as dynamic, can't speak back.

Rhetoric, when used well:

- Knows the soul
- Knows how to react/analyze
- Revise to be effective
- truth - reveals it to the particular audience

All of this is done contextually. Works through binaries and opositions in the dialogue. Draws Phaedrus and Socrates, and by extension us, towards the truth of rhetoric, revealing it along the way. An unfolding working towards TRUTH. A good rhetor and a good rhetoric *first* gains knoweldge of both the topic and the audience before proceeding. Defines rhetoric as a system of language use that is concerned with the just operation of the law, politics, and entertainment.

Also argues that writing is fundamentally different in form and kind from speaking, but can still be rhetoric. It can be persuasive, and reveal truths and knowledge to specific audiences as performed and shown here. Lysias's speech, through the work of Phaedrus and Socrates, brings them towards the truth of rhetoric.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
It is a performative and dialectical definition of rhetoric. It clearly has a role to play in society and in culture, and it should be carefully considered in doing so. Along with this, it is important to be educated to be a just rhetor. It also makes cases for the classification of rhetoric, argues about the relationship between rhetoric and philsophy, and provides distinctions between belief and knowledge, and overlaps. Useful in thinking about a long history of rhetoric, and what the ethrics and morals of it are.
