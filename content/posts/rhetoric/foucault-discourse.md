### One Liner
The in societies, language is controlled by various overt and subvert, conscious and subconscious, restrictions and forces in order to control its power as it becomes discourse.

### Summary
Foucault's summary of his project: "I am suggesting that in every society the production of discourse is at once controlled, selected, organized, and redistributed according to a certain number of procedures whose role is to avert its powers and its dangers, to cope with chance events, to evade its ponderous, awesome materiality."

Argues that discourse has been divided in society in to what is said and what is allowed to be said. Into groupings of language that are invested with institutional and organizing power. It does so through rules of exclusion:

1. Prohibitions - taboos, restrictions, etc.
2. Division and rejections - offers the differences between reason and madness, what is accepted and acceptable language. Also what is considered normalized and what is considered disordered.
3. Opposition between what is true and what is false. What counts as being knowledge and the western drive for what counts as knowledge. Describes it as a will to truth and a will to knowledge.

Secondly, discourse is organized through principles of classification, ordering, and distribution. This is supported by internal rules of discourse.

1. Commentary - how discourse gets classified. Examines the gap between the speaker and the listener -> or explores the relationships between discourse, audience, and originator
2. The author-function - how discourse is given ordering. Assigning a role to an originator of discourse (or discoverer) to give it an ordering power.
3. Discipline - facilitates and restricts the distribution of discourse - what/who a domain of knowledge is and what it includes.

The third means of control - conditions of employment of discourse

- Rarefaction among speaking subjects
- who gets to use it - the rules for its use

1. Ritual - qualifications required to use discourse
2. Fellowship of discourse - circulate within a closed community
3. Doctrine - tend towards diffusion of commonly held beliefs
4. Social appropriations of discourse - access to discourse - think education

Discourse is an activity of writing, reading, and exchange which involves nothing but signs. As signs are themselves arbitrary and without meaning on their own, discourse nullifies itself. It only has power because, as a society, we agree that it has power.

In this piece, Foucault presents a methodology for the examination of discourse and how it comes to have power within societies, its organizing structure, and examining how it is able to regulate individuals and societies. This system of critique has four parts:

1. Reversal
2. Discontinuity
3. Specificity
4. Exteriority

Provide insight as regulatory principles of analysis to the roots of thought. They help use to critically examine how chance, discontinuity, and materiality gives rise to language and discourse. It allows us to look at genealogies and archeologies of thought. To examine how series of discourse are formed and the relations to systems of constraint. To see how norms or each series arise. And to see the conditions of the appearance, growth, and variation of discourse.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Systems of analysis and thinking about the rules that organize discourse. Useful as a critique of invention and the power/myth/lore that we give to creativity. Also, a good place to continue to think about what the role of analysis is within invention and the actions of discourse. Also useful in thinking about how rhetoric can act as an intervention within discourse and language structures.
