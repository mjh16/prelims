## One Liner
Proposes a history of rhetoric with a reframed techne which radically redefines individualism and contextualizing speech acts.

## Summary
Finds feminist projects which work to include and write women speakers into the history of rhetoric as another cultural move to highlight certain voices while silencing others. That it still works as cultural gatekeeping, even if more voices are included. Argues that this system of canonization puts emphasis on the individual subject as originator of works, and including women is a start, but it doesn't challenge the underlying logic and ideology of canon formation. Critiques [Campbell](/prelims/posts/rhetoric/campbell/), arguing that her approach and framework re-insscribes issues of identity construction that put pit active vs passive, feminine and masculine. Proposes a radical reconstruction of rhetoric and a new definition of techne that is post-structuralist and feminist. Builds this historigraphy using Foucault's notion of the subject-in-power with the Derrida's deconstruction. Techne, in this definition, becomes a working through, a making the subject, that refuses to acquiesce to the ethical/moral grounds on which it operates. This techne points to a heterogeneity and variety of histories that can resists the active/passive binary. This is, it rewrites the everyday.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Radical reframing of techne. Useful in thinking about how to do an emergent rhetorical analysis, and in the types of work that feminist rhetorical criticism can do.
