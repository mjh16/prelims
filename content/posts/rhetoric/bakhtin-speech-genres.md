## One Liner

## Summary
Brings attention to the variety of speech genres, their differences primary and secondary genres, and the nature of the utterance in the formation of genres. Builds out from utterances, with their style and linguistic characteristics, as the most basic complete unit of communication, and that of language units as a system. Defines the utterance as a marked by a change in speaking subject--which can account for one move up to complete works. These utterances have a mass, a weight, that keeps them separated from other utterances, through its completeness and finality. It marks the end of a speech will. Genres arise from utterances that have been given social weight and agreed upon forms that arise out of a given sphere of communication, with common semantic qualities, concrete situations, and the context.

Addresses and adds to a number of features of utterances and genres.
