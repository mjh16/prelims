### One Liner
Utterances within artistic constructions such as novels work through a double-voiced meaning and heteroglossia within their form as a genre.

### Summary
Proposes a different view of the novel as a genre that features the combination of a variety of linguistic and stylistic units within a structured artistic whole. Thinks about the ways in which this happens, proposing a difference between novelistic styles and poetic styles, where novels align more closely with rhetorical thinking and approaches.

Heteroglossia - that wrapped in any one utterance are layers--social, ideological, semiotic, historical, --that in their expression and tension give rise to meaning through a double movement, a double-voiced meaning spiraling both outward and inward. Represented in a double movement of language in utterances - centrifugal and centripetal. This is easy to see in moments where one utterance has multiple meanings and roles.

Hybrid Construction

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Assemblage theory?
- No one word relates to its object in a singular way
- An assemblage where the originality and creativity is in the combination of pieces.
