### One Liner
Co-evolution and co-development of human and material through the idea of significant otherness.

### Summary
Uses the co-evolution o fdogs and human species to bring together a narrative of significant otherness that is not only written into our behavior and culture, but also into our genes. It is a next step, a development, from the cyborg manifesto in the enacting, unfolding, and emergent convergence over time. The human/dog companionships represents an implosion of nature and culture in a "relentlessly historically specific" way (18). Companionship is a way of seeing, of using critical vision, to examine the development and unfolding of the cyborg and the other.

The Dog/Human companionship is a cyborgian relationship, with human, non-human, material, cultural, and other actors at play, with the dogs and the people being extension of one another's being and vision. To want to humanize the non-human in this relationship does damage to both the human and the dog. To try and seperate the companions from each other changes what it is. The relationship is named as such due to its inscriptional power. It also moves behyond and is a cyborg relationships in is technlogical and biological aspects of the relationship.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
It's ultimately all about the pups which is super awesome. It is alos about the shifting roles of nature, human, and culture, and how they co-inscribe in various ways. It builds notions of the power of discourse, the power of naming, and who is able to speak and why. The nature of discourse, and therefore rhetoric, to define and inscribe what happens in the world.
