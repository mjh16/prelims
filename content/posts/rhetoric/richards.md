### One Liner
The study of misunderstanding, working to understand them, and proposes rhetoric as the remedy through metaphor.

### Summary
Pushes against traditional understandings of rhetoric as correctness, usage, and persuasion. Works with the aims of discourse, interinanimation of words, definitions, and metaphors to illustrate the purpose of discourse. Words themselves are just a part of the meaning, only know what they mean with other things around it.

#### Key Concepts

- interinanimation of words - words work with one another in generative ways. Cannot be judged in isolation, and the interdependence with one another produces action and meaning. Audience brings interpretation to the words
- Metaphor - more than just style or embellishment. Two thoughts in a single word or phrase. Metaphors are inventive and generative, they make meaning
  - *Tenor and Vehicle*
    - Tenor = Concept, object, or person
    - Vehicle = the image that carries the weight of the comparison
- Words and usage

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
I really could return to this as it provides some useful pushback and ways of thinking about rhetoric, especially in how it: **Pushes against persuasion, not just correctness and usage.**
