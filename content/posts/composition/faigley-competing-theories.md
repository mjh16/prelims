## One Liner
Process gives composition a research focus as a discipline, and we need to move from theory to critiquing why, how, and by whom writing is taught in American Universities.

## Summary
Process gives a disciplinary and research core to composition studies in relationship to English. Theories of process give R/C a paradigm which argues for disciplinary status in the academy. However, pursuing competing theories of process and their scholarship have left questions of ideology, power, and writing instruction unexamined and uncritiqued.

Faigley outlines three competing theories of the writing process: Expressive, Cognitive, and Social.

### Expressive
Aims to stimulate thinking by prompting writing. Sincerity and spontaneity are valued. Drawn out of the Romantic expressivism (and its literary counterparts) which celebrates individual expression, exploration, and artistic genius. Romantic notions of creativity are valued.

### Cognitive
Views the writing process as a cognitive process. Looks for how the brain and cognition function and the stepwise forms and moves of the process of writing. Concerned that the research and evidence separates the parts from the whole

### Social
Human language can only be understood from the perspective of society rather than the individual. That it is a social practice that has developed over time in particular contexts.

Argues, however, that composing and writing are influenced by many and a variety of factors. This is especially true for social concerns and community contexts in relationship to the tools and technologies and practices of writing. Explores the paradoxes of literacy and writing in various contexts, and their relationships to power and society. Suggests a socially aware research approach that brings in a variety of views and contexts into conversation in researching the variety of contextualized processes.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Starts us thinking about post-process in relationship to process. A clear movement towards social construction and ideology. Useful to think about different intersections and views of process.
