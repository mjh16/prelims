## One Liner
Exploration of the epistemological and/or ontological basis for composition research methodologies.

## Summary
Uses the exploration of the field of composition as an emerging entintity surrounding the making of knowledge in the teaching and study of writing. This frame is used to define and explore different methodologies in composition and composition studies. North first traces the emergence of composition as a field, then the practices of inquiry and different theoretical approaches to composition. This typology is then used to illustrate how epistemological assumptions drive different types of inquiry and practice. Explores the interrelated histories of composition and English within American universities. Argues that composition as a field arrises more-or-less from FYC in the 50s-60s.

### Practitioners
Lore driven (his wording). Knowledge is made from the practices of individual practitioners and their experiences. It is not theorizes or generalizable, though it may be highly effective within their context and experience. Lore has three functional qualities:

1. anything can become lore,
2. once its become lore it can't easily be dropped, erased, or modified.
3. contributions framed in practical terms.

There is no controlling theory or master plan. Its an accumulation of experiences from practical implementation and informal sharing. Primarily an oral type of transmission, from person-to-person in a particular context. Inquiry is informed by intuition and trial and error. It is primarily reflexive, for own situated practice.

### Historians
Are primarily concerned with who and what came before. Explore directly within the institutions and in the discipline/field at large. They are concerned with recouping, retelling, and rephrasing. Inquiry unfolds in stages. Problem->empirical research->interpretation->distribution. Seek out and account for patterns. Relate and put into context current practices into broader narratives. Argues for disciplinary status out of precedent and history.

### Philosophers
Frame and critique the fields assumptions and beliefs. Examines the underlying conceptual structure of the field. Make knowledge through identifying problems->establishing premises->making arguments->drawing conclusions. Often make connections into composition from outside of composition. Seeks the intellectual and theoretical conversations.

### Critics
Hermeneutical inquiry. What literature would think of using. Look at drawing meaning out of texts an the critical analysis of those texts.

### Experimentalists

### Formalists

### Ethnographers

### Dynamics of Inquiry

### Making of Knowledge in Composition

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Things that may be useful here: thinking about knowledge and practice in composition. Thinking about the locations of knowledge making in composition and why that may be important. Think about some of the qualities of different types within the system and why that is important. Would be useful to think of the different stakes, and go from there. Will want to come back to this and fill in a little more
