### One Liner
Looks back over previous work to elide three axiologies at work in current composition theory: critical/cultural studies, expressivism, and procedural rhetoric.

### Summary
Fulkerson looks back at his previous 2 articles summarizing the state of the emerging discipline to update and theorize the current state of composition theory. He sticks with axiology as the theoretical frame. He sees three overriding axiologies at work in current composition theory and pedagogy. In this overview he sees lots of divisions and specifications that are different within each category. He sees a shift in that all of the axiologies assume some view of process, though it may be different.

### Critical/cultural studies
Features interpretation and analysis of texts and cultural artifacts, with multiple texts organized around cultural themes. Lots of reading, discussion, and analysis of these texts. Writing in relationship to these cultural contexts, with a focus on examining the power relationships that exist within society (specifically western/US culture). Compares it to a literature based composition class. Labels it as "inappropriate" as he is worried about the content of the class and the dangers of indoctrination of students to the teacher's viewpoint.

### Expressivism
Features the views and experiences of student writers and their own exploration of their learning to write. Sees its current version as having a feminist grounding. About granting agency to student writers and developing their own subject positions. Process and self-identification are primary here.

### Procedural rhetoric
Features a variety of approaches concerned with how texts do work in the world. Focuses on teaching students rhetorical awareness and flexibility. Explores the socially constructed nature of discourse in context.

Comes to the conclusion that composition has become a complex field with many different local versions. These have serious implications for how composition is designed, delivered, perceived, and what what it does.

1. This complexity is also represented in the variety of theories at work within composition. Sees many different debates arising out of these axiologies, with genuine controversy over the goals of teaching writing--is its basis cultural studies or rhetoric?
2. That because of this there is a need for an awareness and implementation of a consistent philosophy. Axiology should be consistent with process and with assessment. These should all then represent some consistency with epistemology underlying the course.
3. While we have internal disagreements, they are different from what the outside public thinks writing is, and what its instruction should be

Because of this, we should seek better disciplinary understanding and agreement, with a clear sense of what constitutes writing more generally, and we should prepare graduate students with the necessary flexibility to move from their context into other successfully.

Sees composition as a less unified field now, and that there is a need for coherence and consistency in axiology, procedure, methodology, and pedagogy.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Lots of recommendations and some pretty good summary of what could appear as a inconsistent and incoherent field and assemblage of approaches and theories. Could be useful to work towards a recommendation, or towards greater contextual awareness, or perhaps towards or away form something. Would be very useful in a discipline vs. field argument, what the nature of composition is. Does seem to conflate composition with FYC thoughout, and I will need to check to see if that is consistent.
