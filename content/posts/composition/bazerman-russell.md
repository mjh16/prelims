## One Liner
Bringing perspectives on activity theory into composition studies.

## Summary
### Introduction
Collection offers insights and investigations into the use of activity theory in composition studies. Bazerman and Russell see the two working well together theoretically due to accounting for the humanist perspectives, tools, technologies, activities, and mediations as they are constructed and expressed in writing. Writing is defined here as semiotic signs on a page (or interface) which mediate meanings between people within a context of activities in which people give meaning to texts. The collection explore activity theory related approaches to composition which view human phenomenon as dynamic in-action. In this view, texts (artifacts) are understood as objects situated within activities that give rise to them and use them. Activity theory is something that comes out of psychology.

In bringing together composition and activity theory, a number of interrelated and intersecting perspectives are brought into conversation. Composition itself is one means, one activity system, for examining human behavior. The behavior here is writing, and composition is the study of how, where, and why people write. Within current study, with distributed digital writing via the w.w.w., the activity system has expanded in ways that are large, but all a part of one articulating system. Given this, genres as activity systems, as a way of stabilizing the human action through tools and technologies as meaning is mediated and circulated, makes a useful typology for study.

There are three perspectives presented in the collection:

1. Work and economy - Producing writing and using writing in economic pursuits - "Producing Work"
2. Creating, maintaining, and transforming selves and communities - Social and cultural uses of writing - "Producing Community"
3. Education - Educational uses of activity theory and composition - "Producing Education"

Texts are embedded in people's lives, their uses of them, and their interpretations. To attempt to remove the texts from the activity systems, or the systems from the texts, flatten their effects and limit the ways that they can be articulated and understood. Composing and compositions in this view are rhetorical uses of language which carry out work in.of the world within complex and differentiated activity systems.

### Clay Spinuzzi - Ch. Compound Mediation in Software Development - **Could return to see the tools**
This chapter examines the technical communications of software engineers practices in maintaining a codebase across three different sites. Looks at the differentiation of practices and activities in each of the sites. He notes that the software engineers work within *genre ecologies* at each site and across the sites, and that they engage in *compound mediations*, drawing on many different texts, within each site. Genre ecologies and compound mediates serve as the analytical framework for the activity system. This framework focuses on the interpretative aspects of the genres of tools and the activity system around and coordinating actions with the code base. Each site had a different set of practices and on-screen and off-screen genres that they used in their interactions with the code, such as using the commenting feature, notes, conversations, and reference materials.

This piece gives some really interesting insights into everyday writing, workplace writing, ecological thinking, and distributed and localized contexts and practices. It works well to look at overlapping activity spheres and activities.

### Russell and Ya√±ez - **Get the Title**
Examining activity spheres of the journalism student in the history class, and her struggles at understanding and approaching the discourse community and activity systems of history. Follows her as she is able to adjust and adapt her own meaning and understanding, and to negotiate that with the instructor, so that there is a mediation and co-development across the spheres. This piece is in conversation with transfer scholarship.

The important takeaway here is finding overlaps between activity systems, and looking for networks and linkages across and within them. This has real important implications for the understandings of disciplinary writing and WAC/WID programs and their administration.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
This is a useful collection in terms of thinking about what writing does in the world. Helps to move us from an educational context into a vareity of other activity systems and spheres. It is a still a very human centric view, although it does bring in some good insights into the material practices of composers and text users. Can also think of this in relationship to the research methods and methodology readings.
