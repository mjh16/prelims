## One Liner
Suggests that we should privilege problem solving in texts and writing over the creation of something original in composition.

## Summary
Suggest assemblage theory as a better means of approaching what composition is and what it can do. In framing composition as assemblage, and writing as problem solving, we have to rethink what plagiarism is and the role that it does or does not play in the privileging of certain types of writing and composing activities. Also asks that we rethink notions of creativity and invention in light of this work.

In reframing as assemblage remix become the key concept and the organizing metaphor, with an invitation to rethink citation and intertextuality. It serves to shift a number of perspectives in relationship to pedagogy and curriculum. Asks us to focus on

- what we value in the classroom and in good writing,
- What the role of genre is in our teaching
- Question the role of authorship and originating ideas
- Rethink goals and outcomes.
  - Valuing of rhetorical flexibility and awareness over some aesthetic or creative value

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
This is a very generative piece, and one that raises as many questions as it does answers, not only for digital writing but for composition more generally. It also asks us to question the underlying values and assumptions of composition and what it means to writer. Adds a dimension of thinking about writing beyond just academic contexts into others beyond the classroom. Also offers a different disciplinary lens.
