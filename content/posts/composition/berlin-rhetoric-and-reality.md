## One Liner
Traces instruction of composition in the 20th century to trace connections between rhetoric and epistemology.

## Summary
Traces writing instruction through the 20th century (specifically 1800-1985) in American Universities and generates a taxonomy of writing programs and instructional styles out of the survey. He groups writing instruction into three broad epistemological categories: subjective, objective, and transactional. Out of this historical tracing and typographical analysis, be names and classifieds the rhetoric of these different pedagogical, epistemological, and ideological approaches, and organizes them based on the relationships between the roles of rhetoric, epistemology, literacy, and ideology.

### Objective Epistemologies

Rhetoric | Traits |
---- | ---- |
Current Traditional |
Behavioralist |
Semantic |
Linguistic |

### Subjective

### Transactional

Rhetoric | Traits |
---- | ---- |
Classical |
Cognitive |
Epistemic |

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Thinking in terms of a broad survey that is useful in establishing and tracing the theoretical and epistemological roots of different moments and movements in composition. Provides a link between rhetoric and composition that is rather explicit. The historical and ideological framing offers a useful place to think about the roles of epistemology in the development and unfolding of writing instruction alongside the emergence of rhetoric and composition.

Would also be potentially useful as a framing of historical trends and as a jumping off/breaking off point for other types of composition. Could see how this could fit into a digital, mulitmodal, or other type question well.
