## One Liner
Explores what constitutes a book in the age of digital scholarship.

## Summary
Present, in digital form, a type of scholarly edited collection that deals with what constitutes and counts as scholarship in composition. Through performing and presenting the chapters, the authors and editors  theoretically explore the idea of the book and the work of writing in digital spaces while also bringing attention to the tools, technologies, and practices that go into the creation and distribution of scholarly work. The collection questions what digital composition scholarship is, and what the role of composing and composition research is given digital technologies and influences. Argue that we need to completely rethink the nature of written work and the form of the book give the realities of digital work. That it is not just a difference in form, or a difference in kind, but a difference in the very nature and essence of this work.

They highlight how digital scholarship is and has been strongly interdisciplinary, and see the work of theorizing the book and working with digital research. Rethink the book in digital scholarship and what it does.

### Books

* Subsection of the introduction - been split, interesting choice
* A book is an object
* Books are technology
* “Discussions of digital media often offer related arguments: that they foster different ways of reading, comprehending, or responding to ideas than print texts do.“
* Book is a genre
* “We know how to use the technology of the book because we have learned how to respond to the genre conventions it employs. That is, books are recognizable as books because they share not only formal conventions but also substantive agreements about what books are, what they do, and what kinds of interactions they foster. ”

### Themes

* **New Authors and Authority**
* **New Strategies for Composing and Production**
* This expanded understanding of composing as more than print-based can start, as  [Garrett, Landrum-Geyer, and Palmeri](http://ccdigitalpress.org/book/nwc/chapters/garrett-et-al/index.html)  suggest, at the level of invention. In particular, they argue, while theories of invention often emphasize invention’s nonlinear or recursive nature, scholarship on invention nevertheless continues to be written in conventional print forms that devalue the power of nonlinearity, juxtaposition or embodied performance as ways of making meaning.
* **New Scholarly Genres**
* **New Spaces and Ecologies**
* **The Reflective Nature of Digital Scholarship**

### DeVoss, Danielle "Mothers and Daughters of Digital Invention"

#### Themes - each a quote

1. First, one theme that emerges is that women are marginalized due to the language and practices embedded within technologies and the existence and reproduction of certain lines of authority embedded within technologies.
2. Second, women are excluded from the design processes of most technologies, even those designed specifically for “women’s” domestic work.
* Situated as unable, clumsy, assumed
3. Third, women are situated as low-level users or technology workers, and face segregation in technology work. Women are often situated as consumers and as passive participants rather than as active agents.
4. Finally, women’s technology-related contributions are deliberately excluded from history due to traditional definitions of technology in terms of male activities and male domination of women and nature.

A feminist, digital agenda

### Autumn Stanley
Why do we know so few women inventors?
An option that Stanley overlooked—appropriately so, I think, given her historical focus—is **to resist the intellectual property regime**. To create, share, produce, and distribute outside of this system.

### Digital creation
Highlights three different digital projects that illustrate how women invent differently in digital spaces

### Digital dangers
Discusses issues of IP, Creative Commons, and identity, especially where women are potentially in danger of exploitation or violence. A cautionary approach

### Intellectual property resistance

Rhetoric and composition scholars, along with scholars across and beyond the humanities, must pay more attention to how women, specifically, are using intellectual property systems to protect their work and how they are subverting intellectual property systems as part of their work—how women are deliberately, explicitly inverting the intellectual property regime to foster more collaboration and sharing.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Ok, this is cool stuff, and it asks us to fundamentally rethink what work composition can and should do, and the forms it should take. It is also highly interdisciplinary. Useful in thinking well beyond the classroom and our typical academic contexts for uses, framing, and connections.
