### One Liner
Examines expressive, mimetic, rhetorical, and formalist philosophies of composition and their curricular and pedagogical implementation.

### Summary
Examines four philosophies for composition: expressive, mimetic, rhetorical, and formalist. Finds that many composition teachers either don't have a consistent philosophy, or are unable to have their philosophy coherently influence and shape their pedagogy. That there is a dissonance between what teachers say they want to do and what they do. The article seeks coherence between philosophy and pedagogy, and assumptions about composition with curriculum. He draws upon scholarship, books, and textbooks to examine the emergence and implementation of these philosophies.

Philosophy | Traits | Implications
---|---|---
Expressive | Emphasize the writer | student self-discovery, reliance on lore. Use of journals and personal writing over other forms. Experiential
Mimetic | Emphasizes "reality" | Makes connections between "good writing" and "good thinking." Emphasizes logic and the closeness of writing to reality. Social.
Rhetorical | Emphasize effects of writing on an audience | Focus on the work that writing and composition do in the world. The effects on an audience, real or imagined. Audience and reader focused. Rhetorical/outcome.
Formalist | Emphasizes certain traits of the finalized artifact | Judges work on if it meets certain internal forms. A judgement of writing based on what is theorized as universal assumptions of good prose. Prescriptive.

Draws very explicitly on the work of rhetoric and composition as an emerging field in the 60s and 70s, especially as an area of focus in relationship to others (philosophy, cultural studies, literature). Uses these comparisons as a basis for classification.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Think about in terms of philosophical basis. This could be a glue piece in the history of praxis in composition. Also useful in seeing how something like process bleeds into other areas, or how a social-epistemic view of composition would arise. See how these philosophies of composition are an organizing theory for other movements: Process (expressive), post-process (rhetorical), visual/multimodal (mimetic), current-traditional (formalist). Also, these categories are useful in thinking about how much interstitial space there is between different approaches. Also, useful in thinking about an epistemological versus an ontological history of comp, tracing the theoretical roots and linkages.
