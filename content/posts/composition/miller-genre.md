## One Liner
Genre is social action made of rhetorical and semiotic forms and substances which arise out of reoccurring social situations.

## Summary
Highlights how genres are a point of connection between intention and effect. This synthesis and analysis arouse out of an ethnomedological approach to genre. Genres arise out of recurrent social situations, and the social situations become a result of the genres. While they may include conventionalized responses to recurring social situations, they create the rhetorical situation, they don't respond to it. Genres are inventional in that they create the different parts and players in their interactions, circulation, creation, and response. Genres represent and create typified actors that are rhetorical. Levels and hierarchies within genres themselves.
