## One Liner
(Proposes? Explores) Polymorphic literacy that takes into account the many embodied, visual, and linguistic experiences that come together in composing.

## Summary
The image has been subordinated to language in composition theory. Fleckenstein explores the different types of images that are common to literate practice and explores relationships between images and words. The image is a temporal and spatial experience which serves as an anchor. A polymorphic literacy offers a bridge between word, image, and experience that can lead to praxis. Many forms are brought together in order to transform experiences through texts.

Defines literacy as an embedded, visual, imaginative, and cognitive process by which meaning arises.

Visuals are less stable in meaning making, where language gives an impression of stability. By studying the production and interpretation of images, and how they are situated within polymorphic literacy practices, we can see and utilize the relationships between bodies, images, and language in our practice.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Polymorphic literacy is a useful way of thinking about visuals in composition, and the relationships between visuals and bodies. It is a useful place from which to think about praxis, and to account for other modes of literacy. I like the transformative nature or the bringing together, and the embodied + visual.
