## One Liner
Proposes that a disciplinary paradigm for a "full theory" of composition should include  axiology, procedures, epistemology, and pedagogy.

## Summary

Proposes a "full theory" of composition out of the consensus of purpose that emerged during the 80s. Highlights the diversity of methodologies that he uncovered. Proposes that this theory would have 4 components:

1. Axiology - what constitutes good writing. What is the aim of composition? What is the aim of good teaching in composition?
2. Procedural - describes the means by which writers get to good writing.
3. Pedagogical - What are classroom procedures and curricular designs.
4. Epistemology - What counts as knowledge within composition

In reorganizing the philosophies into axiologies, or aims of the practice, he examines the philosophies from earlier as axiologies, and charts their rise or decline

Axiology | Features | Presence in the 80s
---|---|---
Expressivism | writer focused, exploratory | largely gone in the scholarship, or has shifted into decidedly rhetorical contexts and awareness
Formalism | good writing is correct writing | largely missing (and has been) in the scholarship, pervasive presence in local contexts
Mimetic | reflects accurate information and acceptable conclusions, logic focused, argumentation | seen in re-emergence of stasis theory and Toulmin approach
Rhetorical | towards doing public work towards specific audiences | consensus axiology, purposes driven within social constructed contexts

He then works through how this consensus is displayed in the texts and practices of composition, such as in the emergence of WAC programs and rhetorically focused textbooks. Despite this axiological consensus, there is still a great diversity in process and pedagogical theories. The diversity here comes to have epistemological considerations and inconsistencies. Proposes that we work towards better coherence as a field.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Any good theory of writing ought to be able to answer: What good writing is? What sort of writing do we teach? How do we teach it? And what types of knowledge does it produce about writing?

Useful in thinking about praxis and the dangers of not questioning the epistemologies that our processes and pedagogies privilege. Points out potential areas of inconsistency between axiology of composition with the theories underlying its teaching and practice.
