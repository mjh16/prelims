## One Liner
"Writing is one of the activities by which we locate ourselves in the embedded systems that make up the social world," in a way that is not just thinking but also acting

## Summary
Proposes an ecological perspective on composition and the teaching of composition which draws on educational psychology and linguistics, along with the work in cognitive process. It is a reaction to expressivism as well as cognitive process. The theories and models that we use to inform our pedagogies have deep influence over our attitudes towards students and writing as well as for students towards their own work. We should be conscious of this in our social structuring of our composition classes. Argues that texts themselves are social activities and that writing is ecological, engaging in many different social systems. Ultimately interested in how writer form and create system, engage, interact, respond, and explore with others through, in, and around texts. When writing a writer engages in multiple systems--ideas, purposes, interpersonal interactions, situations, and cultural norms--and the writer (as individual) reads, analyzes, and invents ways to respond and interact in the system. This ecological approach brings the reader and the writer closer together in their interaction across and mediated by texts.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
This approach to the ecological understanding of composition feels very one-to-many, nodes on a network type of ecology. It is certainly useful in thinking about how writing engages in many different systems and ways of meaning. Offers a clear connection and counterpoint to process, and a natural link between process and post process. Provides a number of lineages and histories that bring together rhetorical, compositional, and other research. Has a clear focus on the influence of pedagogy on class content and awareness of context. A very useful articulation and transitional piece.
