## One Liner
Ecomcomposition works as a (literal) framework and subject area for composition theory and pedagogy.

## Summary
Ecocomposition is an approach that brings into conversation place, discourse, and environment in a meaningful theoretical frame for study, but also a pedagogical frame for the teaching of composition. Much of its potential works from the ability of ecocomposition to bring different ecological and composition practices and perspectives together while also working with environmental interconnectedness and how it is expressed through composition. Ecocomposition offers three different frames in which it can operate:

1. As an ecology - examining communities and their methods of communication. Also useful in thinking about the relationships of place to their composition practices
2. As production or construction of texts - that it's not just interpretive
3. Environmental rhetorics - interconnectedness with a larger biology and body of interactions and responsibilities.

Ecocomposition also encompasses two types of pedagogical approaches

1. Ecological literacy - studies of the natural environment and the discourse that surrounds it
2. Discourse ecology approach - discourse and language as en ecology itself

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Thinking about how the metaphors of what we use to organize and talk about our theory and practice influence what the content is. Ecocomposition serves as a strong organizing metaphor for a number of practices that can be organized within composition. It makes valuable connections between process -> post-process and what to do in a post-process world. It also broadens the frame of what counts, and the types of social and material practices under potential investigation when studying writing. Ecology serves and continues to serve as a good metaphor for undersanding not only composition but also the teaching of composition.
