## One Liner
Questions raised by feminist researchers and theorists do have a bearing on compositions studies and should be pursued.

## Summary
Flynn proposes a feminist view and theory of writing based on the research, history, and publications of composition scholars. She highlights how work in process is a feminized version of writing that is messy, creative, and labor that works against the creative genius and privileging of the final written product. She highlights that much of the work within composition has been done and driven by women, shaped by women, or explicitly works to complicate and disrupt binaries. She argues that the field has been shaped by women and feminist work. This disrupts patriarchal attitudes towards the authority of form, context, research, approach, knowledge, etc. A feminist composition focuses on questions of difference and diversity. It highlights the struggle for self identification and voice, and it can be transformative in women's ways of knowing. She then examines different students' writing to present issues of difference and this quest for self-actualization and the realization of voice. She suggests that we take more pedagogical approaches that are feminist, and to write from active positions of experience and power, especially for women students.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Useful in thinking about feminist scholarship and approach to the work of composition, and to think about the ways in which it can be considered and worked with as a critical and cultural location and project.
