## One Liner
Ecological perspective as research methodology organizing research into circumferences for context.

## Summary
Taking an ecological perspective is important for research in composition because of the complex, messy, and contextual nature of writing itself. Working from Burke, and the ways in which metaphors structure and organize our view (screens) they think about the relationships between our research methods and our research questions. Effective and robust research metaphors that harmonize research with phenomenon. Land on an ecological metaphor with circular causality. An important step in the research process is to draw circumferences around the question, the site, the inquiry, and the methods to account for the complex of contexts in research. This metaphor thinks of research as an investigation into a system of relationships in which the web of interlocking social, natural, material, and semiotic practices and processes are examined.

Array of the variety of context needs a diversity of relationships in research investigations. Since writing is ecological, research into writing should be as well. We need to account for the rich environments and let research be guided by possibilities. This frame does bring up questions of the struggle of framing research, what is it, what should it do, and how/where to draw the ecology. Brings attention to the overlapping of questions in research and the work that they do. 

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
I really like this piece, and think that it is useful in thinking about what research is, and what knowledge is, in rhetoric and composition. A useful way of seeing how research fits and the work that it does. Something that I'd like to study a bit more when it comes down to the last few weeks.
