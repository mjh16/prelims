## One Liner
Ideology always already present in the teaching of composition.

## Summary
Explores ideology in the writing classroom through the rhetoric of composition theories. Argues that different theories of composition reflect different ideologies that highlight the epistemological assumptions of that theory. These ideologies structure the classroom and the discourses and power that they represent. Argues that the work of composition should be to bring awareness to the power of ideologies inside and outside of the classroom. Gives a social project and more explicitly ideological imperative to teach the class and to teach it well.

Ideologies at play in composition:

- Cognitive psychology/process
- Expressivist
- Social-Epistemic

Berlin argues for a social-epistemic view as what should be the primary and ideal ideology for composition programs due to the way in which this stance reflects the power relationships and the arrangement of culture and society. Explores concerns with discourse, ideology, and power as presented in writing classrooms. This ideological perspective helps to illuminate assumptions about epistemology and ethics underlying education and society. Helps to answer questions like, what is good, what exists, and what is possible.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Another good summary of the state of composition, especially when thinking about the ideologies and power that underly pedagogy especially. Also useful in tracing what is the work of composition beyond just university walls and that context. That it is and can/should be something more than just what colleges do.
