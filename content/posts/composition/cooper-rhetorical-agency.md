## One Liner
Individual agency emerges from embodied processes, and is inescapable for embodied beings (443).

## Summary
Agency is an emergent quality rather than something that is a quality of the subject. With this view, we need to take careful consideration of the  ethics and responsibility of using and approaching agency in writing and composition.

From Notes:

- Conscious and non-conscious control over agency
- Complex systems theory - expression of agency as a perturbation
- Agent are unique, embodied individuals
- Agency emerges from within interactions in the system

Serves as a bringing together of modern critical theory, post-modernism, and neuroscience.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Human centric - humanistic - makes sense given the tradition. This is also a useful piece in thinking about how agency is a feature of social situations, and the ways in which it emerges within those social situations and is enacted within them. Has some potential to thinking about how and why texts emerge, and the roles that genres play with agency and writing.
