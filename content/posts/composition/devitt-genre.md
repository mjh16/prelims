## One Liner
Letting go of old notions of genre to better understand the roles that genres play in writing.

## Summary
Genre is a concept that is based not on the features of the text, but on the social, cultural, and contextual factors in which the texts emerge and in which they do work. Genres are not a passive form, but rather an active and dynamic force. Genres begin with a rhetorical situation, and expands to include semiotic situated social context. Rhetoric for genre becomes the epistemological mover. As genres coalesce, they construct reoccurring situations, and serve as a dynamic response. Quote summary: "Genre is patterns and relationships[...]that are constructed when writers and groups of writers identity different writing tasks as being similar" (580). This dynamic and socially situated emergence and construction is important to how writers learn genre, how they use genres, and how we teach genres.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
This can be useful in understanding the dynamic nature of genres, how they are a rhetorical mover rather than a passive response. It also gives insight into how genres shape many factors outside of the features of the text itself. It also opens features for the understanding of factors outside of the text as being important to the genre itself. It is also useful in thinking about how they exist in relationship to many different systems and actors rather than being passive vehicles to be filled.
