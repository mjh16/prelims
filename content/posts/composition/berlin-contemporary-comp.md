## One Liner
Taxonomy of four major compositional theories which influence pedagogy.

## Summary
Examines the writer-reality-audience-language relationship underlying compositional theories. Uses this framework to examine the assumptions underlying and realities created by different groupings of pedagogies. Has four groups:

- Neo-Aristotelians or Classicists
  - Reality exists, language a conveyor of that relation. Operates upon sense data. Invention (?) focused
- Positivists or Current-Traditionalists
  - Truth trough induction. Study all forms of communication. Idealist
- Neo-Platonists or Expressivists
  - Bring to truth. Can be learned but not taught
- New Rhetoricians
  - Epistemic. Means of arriving at the truth. Dynamic and dialectical processes.

Argues that each stance creates a reality under which composition is taught and experienced. These realities may or may not be communicated to students. Argues that we need to be aware of these stances, and to adjust them. Ultimately, uses this approach to reveal the deep structure under process and process pedagogies, and to provide theories to which writing instructors can view their pedagogy and instruction of composition. A theoretical underpinning to different composition pedagogies.
