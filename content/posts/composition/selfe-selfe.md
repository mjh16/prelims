## One Liner
Examining digital interfaces as linguistic contact zones encourages a critical and reflective approach to the use of computers in composition classrooms.

## Summary
Selfe and Selfe highlight the unequal distribution of computerized technologies in different socio-economic conditions. In doing so they point to the middle-class and white-collar assumptions that shape computer interfaces, and highlight how these are then different sites in which histories of oppression are written and rewritten.

They illustrate the ways in which computer interfaces are cultural maps of computer systems: desktop, files, cabinets, trash bins, etc. These cultural maps are genres of activities that need to be recognized or learned in order to understand the ways in which there are gestures and omissions in the interface. Computer interfaces privilege a capitalist class. They show how there is a preference for standard English in computer interfaces, and indicate that while there are many attempts and projects for localized language use, that it is still deficient at this juncture. They illustrate how "non-standard" and non-english characters are hidden away behind keystrokes and options, how spell-checkers in built in word processors use standard English. These interfaces map rationalism and logocentrism through the hierarchical representations of data and information as knowledge. The use of computers within composition classrooms is therefore not without issue as they require students of marginalized groups to learns systems of literacy that are oppressive. These silence their own literacies.

As solutions, they first indicate that we need to teach computers as cultural and their interfaces as partial perspectives. As classroom activities, and as broader work within rhetoric and composition, they encourage that we reimagine, redesign, and create our own interfaces that privilege other cultures and literacies. They suggest that we should be both critics and users, and that we should teach and support technology issues alongside the uses of technology. They also suggest that, as a field, we should become more interested and involved in technology design, that we need to have a stake, interest, and skill in software design. We need a conceptual reconsideration of the map of the interface, and that it should be a part of our critical work within these linguistic contact zones. 

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Would have liked to have some images, and this can make some really interesting inroads into overlaps of visual and multimodal composing practices with digital composing practices, especially in thinking of material/digital realities between things. In many ways this predicts issues of access, internet speeds, net-neutrality, and computer literacy that we still work with.
