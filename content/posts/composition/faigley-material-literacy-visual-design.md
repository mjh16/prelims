## One Liner
Literacy has always been material, we are just more likely to notice it when computer technology brings it to our attention.

## Summary
Computer technologies bring the materiality of literacy to our attention in the ways in which it collapses false binaries such as Oral vs. Written. In doing so, he starts by tracing the paradox of alphabetic literacy and the narrative of its attempts to become transparent. He uses the examples of the greek alphabet and the gutenberg press and their attempts to hide or make transparent the materiality of language. The historical trajectories challenge these notions of material literacy as not being concerned with visual design due to the tools that were accessible to the majority of the population. Digital technology, as demonstrated through amateur and adolescent websites of the mid/late 90s, open up the view of visuals in composition by making play and work with them not only accessible but experimental. These uses of digital technology bring attention, oftentimes forced, to the mediated and material reality of literacy. Looks at the progression of images and visuals in digital technology and the ways in which design, through visual means, is an important mode of composition and communication. There is a recognition of how composing does work, and the ways in which digital technologies bring producer and consumer into closer potential contact.

The web and digital technology may serve to help broaden access and collapse binaries, and help to do real critical social and cultural work in the world through its upending of assumptions of writing, and the ways in which it brings attention to the material nature of literacy.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Really, this reads like a HoTT piece (and would be interesting in that context). Also a useful way to think about convergence through digital technology in composition. A nice piece for thinking about how composing works outside of classroom and academic contexts.
