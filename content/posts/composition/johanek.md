## One Liner
Argues for a contextualist paradigm which collapses the quantitative/qualitative dichotomy which is adapted to a variety of research situations informed by the type of knowledge we are inquiring into and the context in which it is housed.

## Summary
Seeks to bring clarity and direction to research in rhetoric and composition by re-examining scientistic approaches in rhetoric and composition. Starts by questioning the sense of a paradigm for Rhetoric and Composition. Johanek works to offer other methods within her contextualist paradigm, thinking of how context should inform methods, and those methods should allow for a variety of types of research. These should be fluid and informed by inquiry.

R/C has been defined, in many ways, by its "methodological pluralism" (Qtd Kirsh 28). Uses this exploration of current research trends to illustrate the preference for the narratives of data and writing, we are word people. In this, we have tended to avoid the scientific method and numbers within our research. Illustrates how numbers can work with narratives to offer richer perspectives and understandings of data and inquiry. We need to be careful not to label and avoid scientistic research as "anti-woman, anti-humanist, or anti-creative" (83). Additionally, we need to draw things together to be more contextually rich rather than split.

Proposes the contextualist research paradigm as one that does this joining together, to see not only the process of research but to better tell how the products of our research arrived, and what they mean. As rhetoric and composition is positioned at intersections and interventions of rhetoric in texts and reality, this rich research allows us to better see the matrix of relationships.

Uses extended examples to illustrate the power of this contextualist paradigm, and offers some ways of approaching and designing richly contextualist research using both qualitative and quantitative data. This contextualist paradigm is presented as a vital need in R/C, one that allows us to systematize our inquiry while illustrating and utilizing our storytelling.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
In order to gain displinary status, as been argued here and elsewhere, a research paradigm is necessary. Offers one here that brings together a variety of methods from our intersectional and interdisciplinary nature. Potentially powerful approach to research.
