## One Liner
Changes in the nature of writing and the proliferation of composing outside the academy are creating a writing public that is digital, multimodal, and connected.

## Summary
There are tectonic shifts in literacy driven by the growth of a writing public, facilitated by technology. Our survival as a discipline (and growth into a discipline in other's eyes) depends upon our embracing of technology and adapting what the role of rhetoric and composition is to understanding the composing in the world. Traces the development of a writing public, which parallels the growth of a reading public during the 19th century. This new writing public, and the literacies that it has fostered, are largely centered around digital and multimodal tehcnologies that are giving rise to many new genres. R/C needs to adapt, acknowledge, and embrace this evolving literacy and it into the discipline. The economy of this writing has been driven by use value, and many English departments are cautious of this change. And skepticism is necessary, but the role of literacy and writing is changing, and continues so, and there is a need to adapt.

Rhetoric and composition is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this situation. We've already been users of technology and print, aware of and studying genres, and conscious to how texts emerge through social and writing processes. We have students in FYC and WAC programs that are in these outside-the-academy writing situations. We know that writing is more than just process, and the writing public could use insight into this context. This will require curricular changes to FYC, WAC, and the development of a major. Need to examine writing inside and outside of the academy. Re-examine WAC and its role in universities. And develop a rich and contextual writing major that has these features. Proposes that the major focus on circulation, genre and media, and transfer.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
I see so much of what Yancey is doing and continues to do: Everyday Writing, TFT, ePortfolios, EWM, 2135....Also makes clear connections to Hairston and Winds of Change, work in genre, work in digital texts, etc. Also a useful benchmark for where measuring the discipline. Also useful in proposing what it can be/do.
