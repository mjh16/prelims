## One Liner
Explores voice, in five different forms, in writing as something that is chosen and enacted as well as an authentic individual experience in writing to present voice as a practical tool with careful considerations.

## Summary
In the introduction to this collection, first explores three major debates about voice--discourse as text vs. voice, ethos as virtue/appearance of virtue, self vs. role, --. He then responds to these debates by illustrating how they don't need to be resolved in either/or binary terms, and that a careful consideration of voice has some useful and noncontroversial applications when applied to writing. Uses the second part of the piece to solidify the concept of voice and to make it useful.

**Issue 1** - Voice as text vs. voice as discourse: Discussions of text vs. discourse as voice. Argues that we should both use our voice(s) to speak or utter onto the page and to use textuality to construct a voice in a written discourse. Voice/text in discourse can be used as an approach to writing and the teaching of writing.

**Issue 2** - Ethos as real virtue in the person Vs. ethos as the appearance of virtue: Parallels issues of voice and identity.

**Issue 3** - voice as self vs. voice as role: what is credibility in writing and where does the person as subject emerge. Pits much of this debate as between a modern and post-modern subject and how it is emergent in writing.

### Part 2 - 5 Features of voice

Voice is a metaphor, and it has as much to do with how we experience our own written production along with how the audience experiences any one sentence in relationship and context with other sentences.

1. Audible voice or intonation
  - Distance of writing from speaking
  - How a silent text becomes an experienced discourse
2. Dramatic voice
  - Implied author in a text, texts have character
3. Recognizable or distinctive
  - characteristic style
  - Develops out of a learned fluency and experience with language
4. Authority
  - An ownership and authority over a voice - that there is a place to speak from
5. Resonant voice or presence
  - Points to a link between discourse and the unconscious
  - With a sincerity, or sense of such
  - What we most often "hear" in a text

Connections of author to a text with voice as the mediator of this experience. Brings together reader, writer, and text as discrete objects within relationships with one another. Says that we make and create a speaking language relationship with the experiences of texts.

Talks about teaching and deploying voice within writing and writing classrooms and taught and learned actions. There is a practice between production of a voice in discourse and in a true voice.
