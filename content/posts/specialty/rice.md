## One Liner
Critiques the history of the emergence of composition as a field in 1963 to propose *A* new rhetoric that is especially attuned for new media.

## Summary
Proposes cool as a rhetorical theory that is especially appropriate for new media, and has deep implications and applications for composition pedagogy, especially where new media is used. Cool as a rhetorical theory that emphasizes change over fixity, and challenges the narrative notions of rhetoric and composition in order to see the multiple ways that composition and new media composition are made and remade by the tools and technologies that are used in its production and circulation. That to have a rhetoric of cool means to be adaptive and aware of the shaping potentials and realities of new media production. Also frames this as a necessary move and perspective as we already live in a postmodern electronic culture.

### Ch. 2 - Chora

Builds cool as a topoi, with common meanings and understandings related to popular culture, that moves from the fixity of print based understadings to a choral motion of new media.
