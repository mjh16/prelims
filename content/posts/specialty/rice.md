## One Liner
Critiques the history of the emergence of composition as a field in 1963 to propose *A* new rhetoric that is especially attuned for new media.

## Summary
Proposes cool as a rhetorical theory that is especially appropriate for new media, and has deep implications and applications for composition pedagogy, especially where new media is used. Cool as a rhetorical theory that emphasizes change over fixity, and challenges the narrative notions of rhetoric and composition in order to see the multiple ways that composition and new media composition are made and remade by the tools and technologies that are used in its production and circulation. That to have a rhetoric of cool means to be adaptive and aware of the shaping potentials and realities of new media production. Also frames this as a necessary move and perspective as we already live in a postmodern electronic culture.

### Ch. 2 - Chora

Builds cool as a topoi, with common meanings and understandings related to popular culture, that moves from the fixity of print based understandings to a choral motion of new media. Chora is a particular way un which to demonstrate digital and new media's rhetorical moves by dealing with and using its connections and interrelated knowledge. The chora, as the space outside and in-between, and with digital writing, as a series of digital patterns and performances of how meaning is made from the interactions. Uses the hyperlink as an examples, itself, of this movement of chora. Choral movemnt and linkages are exposed in their movement in new media texts.

Chora figures as the central movement by which other new media rhetorics are expressed, and cool is the central organizing concept. The chora offers the means by which different propositions are laid out, and are then played with, as they are expressed and produce meaning.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Chora, movement, cool, play, invention. Has some obvious linkages with Rickert, even so far as connecting to the Chora.
