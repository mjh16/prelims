## One Liner
Proposes the cyborg as the embodiment of posthuman transhistorical practices that navigates rhetorical moments according to the occasion.

## Summary
Argues for the image of the cyborg as an [in]tense third-sophistic rhetoric that moves beyond the New Rhetorics as occasioned by  political atmospheres and realities. This third-sophistic cyborg is embedded in postmodern and posthuman rhetoric. Considers the third sophistic as being emboldened and defined by an understanding of mêtis that embodies postmodern rhetorical practice.

### Qualities of the third-sophistic cyborg rhetoric

- Called into being within the moment - "exists rhetorically in a rhetorical moment as a rhetorical trope or figuration" (55).
- Answer 21st century postmodern conditions with skepticism that challenges seriousness
- Existence is a threatening to binaries which uphold institutions
- Rhetoric as a troping figuring
- Cyborg-as-speaker and cyborg-as-audience (because it's both) is not fixed - both are situated but it is contextual
- Cyborg is disruption to the system
- Given the simulated nature of society and culture (a simulacrum), the cyborg is necessary as a artisans (using mêtis), not philosphers (using technê)
  - Technê is also prefigured as a technology that rises out of crafting an artistry
- Perpetually emergent and engaged

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Hell yes it fits and works. The largest things here are thinking about it as a two-faced, at odds, moments of practice and artistry that are embedded in many different intersections. Situated in the political action of radical democracy as a necessary condition for the 21st century in order to push against complacency and hegemony.
The whole thing is beautifully assembled and written.
