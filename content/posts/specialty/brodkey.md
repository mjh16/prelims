## One Liner
Examines the modernist view of the solitary writer writing alone in order to form a new scene of writing based on imagination and the tensions in the scene of writer-reader-text.

## Summary
Looks at the modernist conception of writing--an individual, writing alone, in service of the writing, often male, as an observer or traveler in the world of others--and its roots within the literary conceptions of the author. Illustrates this view and examines the ways in which it is disruptive to the composition classroom due to its weight in shaping the scenes in which we and students imagine as where writing occurs. It also tends to erase the reader, and in many ways the text, viewing writing and its scene as a transcription, a machine like transmission, from writer to potential audiences. In examining the scene of writings, notes that this view conflates one moment in writing as writing, and excludes all others. This scene of writing has been given hegemonic power due to its cloistering of the writing act away from social and cultural realities into a moment of a posteriori reporting. Works through and disrupts binaries in this modernist conception related to the writer and the work they do, demonstrating how an atomistic and removed position for writing is at odds with the sorts of knowledge that is generated out of these experiences.

Presents a revised scene of writing that reconceives the mind as an act of imaginative resistance from a view as a writing machine. In doing so, it returns writing to the social, aesthetic, cognitive, and material reality of language and language production. Out of this revised notion of the scene of writing, sees the context of research and pedagogy for rhetoric and composition as a social, historical, and political construction of the individuals and the collective identities that intersect with those moments.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Interesting to think about in relationship to the other pieces that involve the use of actor network theory, and especially CHAT. Also a good disruptive feminist critique of the powerful metaphors and images for the scenes of writing that are held. Can be used to think about social construction and the work of writing research and pedagogy in constructing the realities in which it exists.
