## One Liner
Through studying creative individuals and their creative and composing processes, proposes a connection between creativity and flow states where the activity of being creative/productive is the focus of the activity over the product of the creative labor.

## Summary
Proposes that many human activities are creative, and that one action associated with creativity, and exceptionally creative people, are flow states. In these flow states a person "becomes one" with the activity and the tools of production for that activity. Creativity is an activity and flow is one way of being creative. With this there is a skill and a practice that goes into being able to achieve flow states, and creative individuals within their domains have a motivation to acquire this skill. Engaging flow states involves a move from one reality into another sphere. Problems, as reported by many creative people, often operate in this way, describing them as physical and material even when they are non-corporeal.

There are generally four phases that creative people flow through:

1. Preparation
2. Incubation
3. Insight
4. Elaboration

He then highlights how there have been different views of creativity throughout history, and of these there are two main types: "Big C" Creativity and "little c" creativity. Big C = things which move a culture, change how the world runs for human beings. Things like big ideas, inventions, products, policies, etc. Little c = everyday things people do, cultural construction with importance. This creativity is an end in itself.

### Systems model of creativity
Especially useful in thinking about and examining Big C creativity. This is a system with:

- Domains - sets of rules and practices
- Fields - set of practitioners within a domain
- Individuals - an individual within the system

Within this system, creativity is a process by which a novel(ty) produced by an individual is selected by the field for inclusion in the domain. This is a complex interaction that is not linear or circular, but it is recursive and it does build/deconstruct as it progresses. This is important for thinking about how domains and fields contain and address creativity, access to activity, and the acceptance or rejection of ideas and individuals. In educational contexts brings an importance for people learning domains and having interests in them and the fields surrounding them. This also explains how creativity individuals need a supportive environment for their own creativity - how things seem to arise within particular contexts. There is a need to accept and understand the domain in order to change it, and the perseverance to play with it. Passion for the work, especially the process, but a detachment and a critical distance seem to be traits of creative people. These creative people tend to mix, blend, understand, and challenge the typified cultural traits and assumptions of their domain.

### Flow and Creativity
As creative output is linked to flow states, it is important to keep flow sustained, there are new challenges that need to arise within the domain. Creative individuals tend to increase the challenges and skill as they work within their domains. Understanding flow and creativity can help us work with and against domains. This is important for learning as it gives us a way of thinking about how experiences and activities are generative and useful, and how flow creates spaces in which creativity happens.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Well, it gives some nice linkages between creativity, production, composition, education, and flow. Also offers some ways to think about how creativity can be rhetorical, and how play can intervene within.
