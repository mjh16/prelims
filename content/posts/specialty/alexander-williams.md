## One Liner
Proses a theory of distributed invention in which two or more people engage in proximal composing and sharing of ideas, where collaboration becomes a site of mutual appropriation and evolution.

## Summary
Uses the experience of sharing a room at DMAC, and working on projects, to highlight the ways in which working near someone creates new inventional potentials and possibilities. Explores the spatial nature of invention, and the ways in which the intentional and unintentional arranging of people and materials in places facilitate different kinds of invention. Looks to extend notions of invention beyond genre and social conversations, and into the material and generative potential of material.

Distributed invention is:

- Social
- Mutually appropriated
- Epistemic
- Negotiated
- Situated
- Proximal
- Responsive
- Interruptive
- Transformative
- Trust-based
- Idiosyncratic

They synthesize this theory of distributed invention out of their DMAC experiences, and the ways in which they each then took the idea back to their home institutions. See this notion of distributed invention as useful in creating environments and opportunities for this sort of work within the spaces and classrooms of day-to-day practice and pedagogy.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Useful as a bridge into action from invention, and the articulations back and forth. Additionally, it is a place to theorize out of experience. Feels very large for what they experienced and then set out to do.
