## One Liner
Defines invention as providing guidance into beginning writing, exploring ideas and arguments, framing insights, and examining writing situations and that it occurs within specific cultural, social, and historical contexts.

## Summary
Examines the history of invention in rhetoric and composition through two broad frames. The first covers issues in invention from classical through the mid-20th century, and the second from the mid-20th to ~2000. IN doing so, Lauer explores the difference between a classical view of invention, through the enlightenment, and finally in 20th century views, connections between theories of invention and classroom practice. The book also serves as a reference for invention, the history of invention, and keyterms for invention. It also works to make connections between inventional theory and composition pedagogy. Uses the trace and the references as a basis for a contemporary inventional pedagogy.

Highlights four major issues that are discussed in the book:

1. The nature, purpose, and epistemology of rhetorical invention - historical
2. Purpose of invention
3. Invention's epistemology
4. Inventional pedagogy

### Ch 2 - Terms

This chapter defines terms that are important to invention

- Techne
- Kairos
- stasis
- dissoi logoi
- topoi
- enthymeme
- example
- epistemic
- heuristics
- tagmemics
- pentand - with 6th term added later in attitude
- hermeneutic Practice
- intertextualitity
- signifying practices
- subjectivity
- cultural codes

### Ch 3 - History until mid-20th century

Traces rhetorical invention from its roots in classical greek rhetoric as of a significant importance, to it's its placement in current-traditional pedagogy. Goes from something that is viewed as generative, as a source, to a view as strategic acts that provide discourse with a direction. Seen as a means of recognizing and acting out of that recognition of forms and responses. Very much a practiced skill.

### Ch 4 - 20th Century Invention
Turns to a search for the nature, purpose, and epistemology of rhetoric in general, and the role of invention within those spheres of rhetoric. Lauer explores new types of invention that arise due to new epistemologies of writing.

- Phenomenological
- Post-modern
- Psychological
- Literacy
- Process

Along with an ongoing search for the development of epistemolog(ies) out of writing, there are different opinions on the role, place, nature, and purpose of invention. Ends with an exploration of the debate between hermeneutic and heuristic views of invention, and how this is a place to disrupt notions of understanding about invention.

### Ch 5 - Pedagogies
Discusses the pedagogies from the epistemologies mentioned in chapter 3 and towards a synthesis for an inventional pedagogy. Lauer discusses the importance of four formative factors, the merits of different inventional strategies, the social nature of invention, the interpretive practices, and the epistemological basis.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Nice historical tracing. Does well to think about invention over rhetoric's history and how this may fit. Also a good articulation of how different inventional epistemologies translate into pedagogy.
