## One Liner
Complicates the individualistic and atomistic view of invention by arguing for a wider lens that takes into account social language and culture, social histories, and a history of ideas.

## Summary
Usefully expands what invention is, situating it as a social process that an individual plays a role in, and an important role, but not the only role. Proposes the view of invention as a social act that questions a view of invention as a *motion of discover or recovery of existing knowledge.* This is a view that has been passed down through an empirical tradition that views knowledge as existing in the world, and the role of individual rhetor is to discover it and brining it into the world in a proper way. Critiques this view in offering invention as a process of inquiry and investigation, as a *dynamic* process of producing discourse in a social context that is an active production.

### Ch 1 - A Platonic View of Rhetorical Invention
Defines invention as understood, and provides an overview of the study. Composition has favored this view of invention as it stresses the role of the individual and the searching for things to say. It has a history in romantic idealism, and it reflects the cultural and intellectual traditions that favor and reward the work of the individual. This view of invention is as a closed and one-way system. It does encourage reflection and builds confidence in writers, but it tends to be a closed system. Also fails to notice the collaborative aspects of invention.

### Ch 2 - Invention as a Social Act
Discusses the inadequacy of atomistic individual invention. Argues that invention is a social process where:

1. The inventing self is socially constructed
2. Invents using language in social systems such as discourse communities
3. Invention builds on a genealogy of socially constructed knowledge
4. Invention may be enabled by internal dialogue with an imagined other or audience.
5. Writers often invent collaboratively
6. Invention is influenced by institutions and contexts
7. The value and worth of what is invented depends on the social grouping - don't invent in a vacuum

This view of invention is an active and dialectical production of knowledge that involve a variety of social relationships. Generally it is done with an audience in mind. This view stresses the *dialectical relationships between individual and society and culture* (47).

### Ch 3 - A Continuum of Social Perspectives on Invention
Provides a means to view invention as a social act and discusses how it emerges. Examines view of invention as existing on a continuum: Platonic, internal dialogic, collaborative, and collective. Each step on the continuum provides unique and useful insights into the nature of invention, but is incomplete. Think topoi, or Burke's Pentad, and how it focuses you in certain directions. Internal dialogue has psychoanalysis as a theoretical base. In composition it is expressed as the internal dialogue for a writer. Invention as Collaboration builds on George Herbert Mead and how knowledge is generated, with a focus on the need for collaborators and negotiations between other individuals. In collaboration a certain resonance can be achieved. (Oh Rickert!)br

### Ch 4 - The Role of Language: A Foundation for a Social Perspective on Invention
Proposes a theoretical framework for invention that is social.

### Ch 5 - Implications of a Social Perspectives on Invention
Theoretical view of the roles of language in a view of invention as a social act.

### Ch 6
