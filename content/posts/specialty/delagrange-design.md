## One Liner
Design as embodied rhetoric that constructs and reconstructs the body in production of digital/visuals and in their reception.

## Summary
Sees discussions about the disappearance of the body in digital and virtual reality conversations as a problem. Examines issues of the assumed normative body. Examines how the immateriality of the body, from the emergence of Cartesian dualism during the Enlightenment, and the collapse into the normative male body as the default cultural assumption. A re-emergence of this immaterial perspective in digital and visual rhetoric, and in composition pedagogy, is a dangerous erasure of bodies, especially vulnerable ones. Examines visuals and visual rhetoric through an embodied pedagogy lens that views embodied performance through visuals as technologies of the bodies, framing all work as embodied. This is especially salient with the interplay between meaning, enacted, feeling, and knowledge. Sees visuals and design as asking us to see the embodied form, and to make visible what is invisible. Design becomes a way to question and interrogate interactions between digital/visual/material spaces.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Useful in thinking through the embodied nature and placement of actions of rhetoric. Thinking through design as a rhetorical practice, and a way of bringing bodies into relationship with one another.
