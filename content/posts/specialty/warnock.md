## One Liner
Imagination brings order to sense images through the production of mental images out of perceptions, which can allow thought to be applied to objects in the world. 

## Summary
Traces a thread of imagination through time and to education. Works to connect imagination to the commonplace perceptual experiences to interpretations of those perceptions. This connection comes about through the creation of mental images. Connects this thread of imagination through philosophy and literature, spending time with the romantics, artists, philosophers, and educators. Starts by examining Hume and Kant's systems of consciousness and perception to examine how we construct our world through imagination through the application of mental images to our sense experiences. The imagination is the way in which we connect the abstract and linguistic with the perceptual. It brings order to sense experience, takes those impressions, works on them, and makes images of them. Makes a link to creative expression and criticism through the ways in which these creations and manipulations of sense perceptions are brought to imaginative construction that give order to sense perceptions.

Using the romantic poets, Warnock illustrates how imagination works to give shape to discourse and art through inner perception and work, and to connect these to emotive and embodied feeling. Uses the romantics, and their developed sense of the individual poet and creator, to make this concrete connection between outer perception and inner sense. Imagination helps to bring together a theory of creativity, sense, and perception with the practice of encouraging imagination to make those tangible/intangible connections. Imagination, in this way, functions both with the presence of the object and in its absence. Images are brought together with external senses and internal perception.

Imagination has many functions, then, in bringing together senses, images, and perceptions. The first is that imagination has an epistemological function in stabilizing the sense so they can be categorized, named, and reproduced. It allows a sense to become an image and to travel. In this sense, argues that the imagination is by definition visual. This raises issues for other sense modes of imagination - it is both a way of interpreting sense data from the world and a way of thinking about objects in the world. These two are joined and have different meaning and interpretations, and yet are joined within signification.

Imagination, then is the ability to bring thought into the world through our sense and perceptions. Imagination is the means by which we make sense of the world of our many senses and how they interact with our thinking. Real objects in the world are made out of mind-stuff and thought, and mind-stuff and thought are impressed with things from the world. In this way, imagination is a means of making connections to the world beyond what is physically in front of us. Imagination is therefore necessary to apply thought to things, and to have things become images. This is a learned behavior, which also needs educating, to bring and cultivate this imaging into the world. Sees the encouragement of creativity as a vital need, as these imaginative connects are necessary, and we need creativity and play to think through and learn how to apply images and thoughts to things, and to allow our senses and perceptions to talk to one another.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Is she saying that imagination is a way in which we link epistemologies with ontologies? Useful in thinking about why teach imagination, and in making connections between experience, thought, and creation.
