## One Liner
Technology, and often digital technology, is not only important to our environment and how we interact with and within it, but it transforms our knowledge about self and the world.

## Summary
Claims that rhetoric must diffuse outward to include the material environment, things, our own embodiment, and a complex understanding of ecological relationally as participating in rhetorical practices and their theorization.

To do so we must recognize ambience as molding materiality and the environmental properties with human design become integral together to the whole feeling and thought of a piece/artifact/experience. To experience and study ambience we must attune to it. This attunement is an entanglement with environments that opens us up onto the ambience of all things, and it is co-responsive and inclusive interaction that brings both immersion and specificity.

In order to do this Rickert turns to Heidegger to theorize that ambience is what surrounds us as material, spatial and environmental. That is conveys our affective investment and emplacements. And that ambience has a certain kind of agency that is disperse and diffused. Paying attention to ambient rhetoric become increasingly important with the rise of ubiquitous computing that take advantage of and exists within our environments, sensing and reacting to them. Rhetoric is no longer just performative, but it has a material dimension that is embodied and embedded practice. Text is just one element in a large array of things, feelings, peoples, and forces. Shifts rhetoric from a focus of being recipients of an impartial and impersonal process, but as correspondents who dwell collectively.

### "Towards the Chora: Kristeva, Derrida, and Ulmer on Emplaced Invention"
This chapter, taken from an article of the same title, illuminates how rhetoric and invention rest on an interplay of revealing and concealing, between, that is, a generative "infomaterial" matrix difficult to apprehend but out of which we work for our rhetorical production and within which they achieve their vibrancy. Minds are both an embodied experience and emotion/sensation and a dispersion within the environment. It is a composite of intellect, body, information, and scaffolding of material artifacts. The chora helps us to see what is available as means for rhetorical generation. Chora is a concept of space that is older, topos a concept of place that is newer. These are both relational, where a beginning already entails a pasts and the ability to recall it. A beginning cannot be an isolated, founding moment.

The chora implies that the place is not simply an immediate environment, but that it includes it includes the background by means of which things show up as they are. Kristeva help us see choric invention as a particular form of beginning, that eery inventional act involves a (re)learning of how to invent. The chora here is a complex grounds of spaces and places where in attuned beings can invent. Invention is not just a means to an end, but that it attends to the possibility conditions. This replaces the notion of static topos with plastic and evolving spatiality of choric invention.

A discourse of representation cannot capture invention. Representation can describe methods or paths by which invention can occur, but it is impossible to impart this with invention itself. Invention involves a movement from ambient inhabitation to representative symbolicalicity, and incorporates a number of factors and influences. It gives rise to rhetoric and then also withdraws.

### Conclusions
That commitment to place is not static, but a recognition that movement, activity, and building are what disclose and create a place, alongside the attunements to place that bring it into such disclosures and creations. It is a double movement. Play as the "whirls-of-being-in-the-world," that is emergent activities. Discourse a movement that becomes suasive in the world.
