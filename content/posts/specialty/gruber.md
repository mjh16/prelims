## One Liner
"Keen use of digital resources allows rhetoric scholars to focus on practices and see documents as important, but wrapped up with machines, bodies, expectations, and instruments in a 'mangle' that makes science the messy work of managing the unknown, the impractical, and the unpredictable."

## Summary
Proposes that rhetoric scholars in the digital humanities use new materialist perspectives, specifically multiple ontologies, to move the digital humanities and rhetoric as a field to questions and research that is concerned with more than just creative textual analysis. He uses and explores three novel digital humanities projects to demonstrate what a rhetoric of scientific practice in DH might look like. Makes rhetoric about, in part, engaging material worlds and realities and to contributing to scientific practice.

### Project 1 - Sentient Room
Looks at a project that put Arduino sensors within chairs that would the tweet based on the usage of the room. This is a project helped to illustrate how the material world is involved in and influences practice. Draws attention to the non-human objects and their roles in human affairs. Analysis as a process of observation and invention that is aware of the happenings and influences, in the world.

### Project 2 - Ontological Carpentry and Imaging Devices
Examines how tools like imaging technologies and devices construct particular views of reality and that they contribute to the making of science. Embrace modes of inquiry associated with programmers and craftspeople. Helps us to find new and productive ways to use digital tools. Digital arts and digital play are rich locations to explore rhetoric in the material world.

### Project 3 - Affect and Action in Medical Settings
The third project involves the uses of digital tools to map affects in a heart surgery setting. It was an empirical and speculative developmental project that sued video to record open-heart surgery. This revealed previously unknown actions and persuasive forces that often go unnoticed within official narratives and documents. These connections, such as the drawing the figure of the heart with the patient's blood, and the surgeon taking in the hospital grounds, become important in making connections between the body, artistic practice, and situated technical and scientific ways of seeing. Illustrates how designing digital humanities projects that emphasize material and bodily interactions help identify important human and nonhuman relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed.

### Conclusion
Uses these cases and perspectives to argue that in addition to textual analysis in the digital humanities, that approaching alternative and material modes of investigation, thinking, being, and doing in a rhetoric of science, that may allows us to not only see things differently, but to recognize more of the human and non-human interactions and partnerships by using digital means.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
I really like this piece, and think that it is a great sounding off point from which to start thinking about the influences of technology and new materialist perspectives on the work of rhetoric and science.
