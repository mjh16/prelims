## One Liner
Revising the canons, and presenting deep examples as such in the nodes, through a Cultural-Historical remapping of rhetorical activity.

## Summary
Takes the opportunity to theorize new roles and relationships for the canons, producing an assemblage (text doesn't use that term) of rethinking and remediation through the use of a Cultural-Historical Activity Theory remapping of the the canons. In this process, they have a core text which examines delivery, thinking of it as mediation--and in effect remediation--in which texts and their producers are engaged in contextually sensitive and aware interactions that brings attention to possible rhetorical configurations. The text is set up as an unfolding, through the experience of reading/viewing/experiencing the text, to demonstrate the laminations and experiences of the (re)mediation of the canons. We experience the remapping and re-situating of the canons along with the authors in their piece, there is  a sense of watching the deliberations and collaborative nature unfold through time and space as you read the piece. The central text uses delivery as the example,

- CHAT argues that activity is *situated* in concrete interactions that are simultaneously *improvised* locally and *mediated* by historically-provided tools and practices, which range from machines, made-objects, semiotic means (e.g., languages, genres, iconographies), and institutions to structured environments, domesticated animals and plants, and, indeed, people themselves. and "Mediated activity means that action and cognition are distributed over time and space and among people, artifacts, and environments and thus also laminated, as multiple frames or fields co-exist in any situated act. In activity, people are socialized (brought into alignment with others) as they appropriate cultural resources, but also individuated as their particular appropriations historically accumulate to form a particular individual.

In looking at the canons, argue for them as chronotropically laminated frames of literate activity in intersecting activities with histories and contexts. They propose that this view using CHAT can mediate new canons that better represent the complex interactions of new and digital media. The main text then breaks off into individual nodes which explore certain (re)mediations.


## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
This text feels like an edited collection as webtext. Would consider returning to for a deep dive into an article or two. It is a really useful theorizing along with a remediation of what they are proposing. It is a good way to see and experience what is possible along with getting the theory. It is more than the sum of its parts.
