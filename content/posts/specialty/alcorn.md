## One Liner
Offers a Lacanian theory of discourse to better account for subjectivity within English studies where there is a focus on composition studies.

## Summary
Critiques a cultural studies as the subject matter for English classes as broadly represented in writing and literature classes. Uses shifts in the subject matter of English into a cultural studies approach. Along with this shift in subject matter he outlines a shift in the goals of English classes. In doing so, English has adopted an incomplete notion of subjectivity. Sees the project as being useful within all divisions of English, but focuses the text on composition. Takes up Berlin's discussions on rhetoric, ideology, and composition.
