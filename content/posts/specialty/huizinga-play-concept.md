## One Liner
Offers a historical approach to play and offers insights into play's significance to the development of cultures.

## Summary
In approaching a history of play as a significant and defining aspect of human cultures, Huizinga starts by examining play as a naturally phenomenon that is more than just physiological or psychological. Play, he argues, is a significant and signifying activity that mediates understanding between people. Presents this as a play-concept--a tension, mirth, and more than fun--that can be examined in a variety of societal and cultural structures. Notes that the word fun, as a concept, is unique to English, and that there must be a cultural reason fo it being so. Presents play, and homo ludens, as a vital part of the definition of modern humans.

He examines the play-concept in language, myth and ritual, and civilizations. Argues that the play-concept is necessary and a basis for civilization. The play-concept offers variations on a theme in the learning and sharing of culture that allows for the learning and internalization of ideologies.

In looking at the social manifestations of the play-concept he sees the following characteristics:

- Play is voluntary
- Serves as a break from the ordinary
  - A way to tease out and work with culture/society/ideas work in contexts by playing with them out of context
- Play has a duration and a location
- That there are rules to play - both official and understood
  - But that they can be malleable within reason - see children play.

The play-concept as expressed by ritual is an embodied, cultural, practiced, and organize (and formalized) presentation of play. It is a play that has been circumscribed to a particular space and action. This is a vital type of cultural work. It represents a stepping out of the common order into a prescribed different space.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Play as important to learning, and play as vital to culture, learning, and society. Sounds an awful lot like how play could be rhetorical, and offers some ways to start examining its suasive power. Also gives it its own epistemology, both within play-concept systems and more broadly.
