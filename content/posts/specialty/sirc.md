## One Liner
We should reconsider English Composition and the spaces in which it occurs as experimental and happening, and that composition is a necessary place for radical exploration of what it means to be language using and social beings.

## Summary
That in an effort to become a discipline, composition because sterile and institutional and has come to reflect those spaces in theory and pedagogy. Presents a disenchantment with established spaces and a desire for new forms (pulled by new media), and that the scope of composition has become too narrow, even as it has become technologized. The academy of writing supports academic writing, which is a tension. Argues that we should reconsider the work of the past, and of compositionists inside and outside of the academy, to see experimental forms, teaching, and pedagogy. This looking back is necessary to address the deep humanity in the world an dour work. Issues is that composition has become too structured, too obsessed with academic legitimacy and disciplinarity , that it has lost its connections to students and to culture. That we should reimagine these spaces and think of composition as a happening that we can unlock new potentials for students and for composition as a whole. The presentation of composition as a professionalized discourse doesn't exists, that it is mechanized, and that it loses the aura of composition. That we need to strive to work within a modern project that pushes at prescribed boundaries.
