## One Liner
Brings together Foucault's author function with Bawarshi's genre function to articulate the multiple frames of being for scholarly webtexts and their readers/users.

## Summary
Exams scholarly webtexts composed by Anne Frances Wysocki, Charles Lowe, and Collin Gifford Brooke as representative of a range of approaches to new media and multimodal production. Explores how Foucault's author function and Bawarshi's genre function reflect the values of computers and writing. Largely reads across the texts to argue that when texts are digitized they author-function operates in multiple and uneven ways. From this plurality of selves, turns to the genre-function to examine how the situations, practices, relations, and identities within the webtexts to examine how they are functioning as social actions of discourse. A focus on the ways in which genres provide and create these different contexts helps us to see how they interact and produce meaning. Along with this, Basgier suggests that turning these modes of analysis on new media offer useful frameworks to examine the work of colleagues within rhetoric and composition. They are reflexive frames, meant to illuminate scholarly moves and generic concepts. This framework of looking allows us to see our own textual, social, and genre practices.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Meh. Useful in thinking about analysis of webtexts, and how there are inventive/creative consequences and outcomes in context with the rest.
