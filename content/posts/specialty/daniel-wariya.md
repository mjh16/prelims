## One Liner
Play is symbolized non-discursively within magic circles, and new media allows for play to be symbolized within new media objects.

## Summary
New media facilitates the symbolization of play within new media objects by allowing play within certain types of media within other media's spaces. As a tool and a technology, new media blurs traditional boundaries between mediated spaces, and producers and consumers. Play, in this fashion, is an intrusion upon one media's magic circle by another - a language and action of one actor upon another media.

Provides a definition of play as rhetorical for computers and writing as a field. This definition of play, as a movement within, through, and against the rule structures of composing mediums that creates a variety of rhetorical forms and expressions. Mediums become possibility spaces upon which rhetoric can unfold as through relationships and restrictions. This brings attention to the actions, the play within media, and within rhetorical composing.

Possibility spaces in new media have four interactions of importance

1. Creates endless repetition
2. Adapts and is flexible to customization
3. Interacts with non-human things
4. Makes variations prolific and inevitable

Symbolic play and the non-discursive: Play as non-discursive symbolization expresses ideas, shares attitudes, and persuades through forms.
