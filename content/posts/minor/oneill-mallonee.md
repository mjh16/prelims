## One Liner
By closely examining the history of the emergence of the department and history of the major illustrates how local history directly influences major curriculum design and administration.

## Summary
Examines the history of the writing program at Loyola University Maryland, the emergence of  writing department out of that institutional history. In their liberal arts context, core writing has an important campus-wide connection as a requirement, but they treat it like the introduction to other disciplines, and it serves as the gateway course for the major and minor. A break from English originally occurred to assist in the administration of core writing and the WAC program at the university. It later morphed into a communications department and then split again (by dean fiat), that was largely production for both departments. The Writing Department now have 2 majors, a minor, a writing center, and manage a number of co-curriculars.

The major is a vertical curriculum with creative writing, professional writing, and rhetoric classes, and a senior seminar. The department also offers an interdisciplinary writing major with credit hours split between writing and another major (more total credits, but less in the writing department), and a writing minor. The FYC course is situated amongst all of the other core classes, and is a requirement for the major. It is a disciplinary course, not viewed as a service course, and is seen as a first step for novice writers in many different contexts. This structure has led to a variety of undergraduate courses and offerings, including fiction, nonfiction, poetry, professional writing, and rhetoric within the writing department.

Keys to success within this context have been adaptability and flexibility. Their narrative has been largely shaped by its institutional context: Jesuit University, the creation of effective writing in 1972 in a new communications department, a WAC program started in 1981 via an NEH grant. In 1977, an NEH grant to brought together effective writing and an introductory creative writing course in a an experimental two-course sequence called Empirical Rhetoric, which led to the basis of the vertical curriculum. By 1986 there was a communications major with journalism and media courses offered. This prompted great demand, expansion of faculty, and a growing rift between the communications faculty and those in writing. The dean split the department in 2004, with the writing department developing its major.

They see their context as offering a template for other universities though not a timeline. They see their continuing and ongoing refusal to become a service department or a group of service faculty within another department as part of the reason for their success.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
It's Jesuit, so I like that. The attention to persistence and working within contexts is useful. I also like how composition, rhetoric, and creative writing share a home underneath the writing department, even though journalism is split, and there are then difficulties when it comes to new media.
