## One Liner
Argues that shape is an important consideration when designing majors with attention to technology.

## Summary
Thinks shape is especially important with the writing majors when there is a overt consideration of technology's effects on writing. Ability to navigate in and between many different contexts is a strength of the major. Argues that majors will be more defined by shape of the major than its place.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Nope, not convinced.
