## One Liner
Present a heuristic based on Chronos and Kairos to examine the development of Elon's writing concentration.

## Summary
Use their experiences in the development of the program at Elon to walk through the questioning process that they underwent in the development of their concentration. These are questions that get at local context and needs. They recommend starting with this heuristic inventory to theorize a coherent program identity to then chart development pff of the pairs of perspectives on time: chronos and kairos. They pair this with de Certeau's idea of tactic and strategy. Provide this heuristic framework for the ongoing inventional process of program development. They use examples from Elon's development of the concentration to illustrate how they developed certain spaces using chronos and kairos, along with strategy and tactic.

Term | Definition | Use
---|---|---
Chronos | linear time | long term planning on development
Kairos | opportune time | taking advantage as moments arise
Strategy | form of action for defined spaces | aligns with chronos, how to intentionally build and actualize spaces and contexts
Tactic | form of action in undefined spaces | Sizing on created times and spaces

Being aware of time and timing helps to guide program development and in making informed decisions. This framework of Chronos/kairos and strategy/tactic is heuristic to guide theory and development.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
So, have a vision that is conherent and contextual. Shows how their's developed. Useful in thinking and developing something looking forward.
