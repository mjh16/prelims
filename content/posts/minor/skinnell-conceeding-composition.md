### One Liner
Composition has been viewed as something that American Universities do, and has often been offered as a conscious to meet those expectations and assumptions.

### Summary
Uses ASU and its transformations from a normal school, to a teachers college, and then a university to argue about the place of composition and the role of FYC. Argues that FYC is something that colleges and universities do. He examines the change of English 1 and 2 to English 101/102 as Arizona State developed from a Arizona Normal School into Arizona Teacher's College (and eventually ASU) from an institutional perspective to argue about the roll of FYC and composition and professionalization more broadly. He uses this focus to think about, and theorize, the role of institution and broader socio-cultural factors at play in the requirement of FYC in higher education.

Uses a genetive historical method, which looks at and across different institutions to see how similarities and differences emerged. Makes an argument about disciplinary history out of the concessions of composition using institutional implementations and institutional reduplications as frames. These are used to examine the local exigencies and contexts and their relationship to broader social and national contexts.

The main movement he examines is ASU's evolution from normal school to Arizona State. He uses UCLA, Western Illinois State, and the University of North Texas as other examples within his analysis.

He notes that much of the drive at ASU was due to accreditation requirements. This parallels the movements of English departments becoming literature departments. Accreditation applies outside pressure for courses, what they are called, who teaches them, and when they occur within curriculums and departments. Looks at how Harvard and the Ivy League schools drove accreditation pressures, that then were reflected in land grant universities as a hierarchy of education and research standards developed. This then lead to accreditation being an important marker for universities. Additionally examines how federal educational spending pressures lead to certain developments with GTAs and WPAs in reaction to research fundings.

Concludes with how composition has always been institutionally available as a concession, and it has been configured and reconfigured to meet institutional needs. This may then align with rhetoric and composition's values, and it may not. Illustrates how the genetive historical methodology was used in drawing these conclusions. Composition has not been rendered invisible, and that it never has been within these institutional contexts. Composition is complicated, and that as a discipline we need to take long and short views, micro and macro views, of institutions and their relationship to FYC and composition more broadly.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
What colleges and universities do, the role of composition, and what that means to a variety of different audiences and different stakeholders. Very useful in making disciplinary arguments and relationships between departments and the work they do. Useful in thinking about disciplinary history and the value of work.
