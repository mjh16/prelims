### One Liner
Composition has been viewed as something that American Universities do, and has often been offered as a conscious to meet those expectations and assumptions.

### Summary
Uses ASU and its transformations from a normal school, to a teachers college, and then a university to argue about the place of composition and the role of FYC. Argues that FYC is something that colleges and universities do.

### Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
What colleges and universities do, the role of composition, and what that means to a variety of different audiences and different stakeholders. Very useful in making disciplinary arguments and relationships between departments and the work they do. Useful in thinking about disciplinary history and the value of work.
