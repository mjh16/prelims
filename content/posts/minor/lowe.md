## One Liner
Uses the experience of a major "not done right" to theorize one that is.

## Summary
His experiences with a writing major did not go well. His context was not well staffed, overworked, and have no intellectual or theoretical core. Proposes two key features that will help a major to be successful, especially in his context of a small liberal arts college. 1. Properly staffing the major from the start. 2. working and paying attention to faculty strengths and weaknesses. In order to do this, you hire who is good for your context and then work to fill classes and students that match. In order for a writing major to work equally to a literature major, it needs to have adequate staffing for the task. Also, it works well to first design and revise the major and then advertise and hire faculty to fit the program. It is made more difficult by writing's complex mission in the academy.
