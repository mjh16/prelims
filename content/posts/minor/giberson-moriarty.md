## One Liner
The decisions that programs make in regards to local circumstances have important implications for the broader discipline.

## Summary
Argue that when we create proposals for programs and work within them, we are creating and constructing the discipline for ourselves and for others. That majors are locally contextual arguments for disciplinarity, and build with the broader disciplinary conversation. The collection, ["What We Are Becoming: Developments in Undergraduate Writing Majors"](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/usupress_pubs/27/), argues that majors should be understood as more than just a collection of service courses. That they should offer specialized courses relating to local and global concerns. These have the potential to change the nature of local writing programs along with the discipline as a whole. These, when done well and in response to localized needs, have the ability to attract students and drive demand for innovative course offerings that will change the power dynamics within our departments and on our campuses.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
As a visibility project it makes a lot of sense. It's hard to argue for what we do when no-one really knows or wants to know what we are. There is also the sense of writing as just a tool, and majors help work against this. Seems idealistic on the whole.
