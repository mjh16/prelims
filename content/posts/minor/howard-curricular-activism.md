## One Liner
The development of a writing major challenges traditional views and assumptions of writing and writing instruction.

## Summary
"The process of establishing a writing major can challenge the traditional normative vision of writing instruction and offer in its stead a representation of writing as a discipline and its instruction as part of the intellectual work of the institution" (42). Discusses the context of the popular myth/image of the composition/writing and its instructors as remedial (and of literacy work more generally) and as only a service/skills course that is presented to the University. Major disrupts the assumption that composition is a course with mo real academic content or intellectual rigor. As we create majors we must be aware of this context, and work with the fact that well-publicized and well-designed majors are themselves a public relations tactic in its creation of a material counter discourse. At this juncture we have a wide opportunity across many different contexts to engage in this curricular activism.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Definitely a "what it could be" article. Builds directly from the work in advanced composition in thinking about why and how we teach what we teach. Especially in contexts of arguing for the disciplinary status and moving into other areas of work in addition to first year composition.
