## One Liner
Using narrative, history, close reading, his father's transcripts, and historical composition textbooks, makes an argument about the development and bifurcation of English Studies into literature studies with a focus on aesthetics an the development of middle-class culture and composition with a focus on professional ethos.

## Summary
Uses a critical historical approach to explore his father's college experience, and the splitting of Literature and Rhetoric/Composition as English departments grew into their current form in Post-War America. Using a mixed methods approach—ethnography, discourse analysis, historiography, theory, and pedagogy—Watkins explores his own father’s college education via the GI bill in the late 40s, his textbooks, and his own experiences, as a place to study the development of English studies, English departments, and the bifurcation of literature and rhetoric and composition. He looks at an ethos of professionalism through R/C and an aesthetics of culture, to argue and explore the developing middle class and what is deemed important. He then argues for new pedagogies and approaches to English studies which are rooted in class dynamics and development, with a careful attention to “writing in the wild” along with issues of labor and capital (will return with the conclusion of the book).

Snarky Summary: Disaffected white guy literature PhD reflects on a lifetime of teaching composition, tries to find the meaning. It sets up a binary, have to question it.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Felt like I spent a lot of time reading this and I don't know how much use it will be. However, it is an interesting argument abut the development and placement/importance of a College and University education as an important marker and activity of middle class culture in the post-war era.
Conclusions, goes through the political work of reform - Really thinking about it as a revolution (in the words of reform)

I still find his “writing in the wild” pedagogy feels a lot like other things, and without his own attention to the field at large.
