## One Liner
That we need to move from thinking about advanced composition courses to theorizing what an advanced undergraduate writing curriculum should accomplish.

## Summary
Theorizes the key points of an undergraduate advanced writing curriculum that moves from the work done in advanced writing course, WAC/WID programs, and First Year Composition. This curriculum should:

1. Provide a historical and theoretical awareness of writing as a discipline
2. Prepare students for careers as writers
3. Prepare students to use writing as a means of participating in the public sphere

With these goals, Howard makes the following recommendations:

- Core requirements of a curriculum in history, theory, career preparation, and civic/public engagement.
- Institutionally and contextually responsive
- Be disciplinarily based, public, and professional
- Thought of and theorized as a whole curriculum
  - Develop structure
  - Hire faculty in response
  - Develop faculty based on localized needs and contexts
  - Writing as a subject matter, an activity, and an area of study
  - Recommend public forms of writing
  - Set of courses that are intentional, prepare students for careers
- Students should come away with an understand of the nature of writing (and by extension rhetoric and composition), and be able to join into the conversations of the discipline
- Think institutionally and departmentally
  - Majors, minors, and programs are difficult to develop, implement, grow, and protect

The major serves an important disciplinary and institutional role. It brings a focus and presence to the importance of pedagogy and something that is ongoing. That it serves to provide continuity from FYC and graduate coursework. And it asserts a disciplinary status, because majors are a thing that academic disciplines do.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
This very clearly provides a lineage from Advanced Composition and Writing to writing majors, makes arguments for disciplinarity and the importance of majors, and the relationships of rhetoric and composition and writing to English Departments, Writing Departments, and institutions.
