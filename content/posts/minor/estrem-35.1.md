## One Liner
Introduces special issues on the major in writing and rhetoric as a "where we are."

## Summary
Uses curriculum redesign at Eastern Michigan University to highlight the local factors that went into the redesign. This curriculum redesign was driven by:

1. Needed rhetoric and composition disciplinarily history and research practices to bring coherence between masters program and undergraduate curriculum
2. Sense of possibilities
3. Kathleen Yancey's 2004 CCCCs address

Estrem uses the introduction of the issues to indicate how the special issue is a "where we are" in the development of writing majors. Many of the articles in the issue deal with the local contexts of writing majors and offer tales of caution, frames for developing majors, and future possibilities. These articles and this issue help to ground the major, highlighting themes of place, timing, and advocacy. Estrem also highlights how out of a common theme but differentiated contexts, many patterns emerge in reading across the pieces.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Useful piece in introducing the other concepts within the whole special edition. It would serve well as an example text to bring up in response to a history or synthesis question.
