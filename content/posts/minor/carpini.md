## One Liner
The development of writing majors is fundamentally changing our disciplinary relationship to English and the humanities.

## Summary
Writing majors have the potential to influence disciplines which we share academic homes and intellectual neighborhoods. Those specifically mentioned are literature, humanities, philosophy, etc. This is due to similar interest in the theoretical construction of these different disciplines. Rhetoric and composition already often include undergraduates in theoretical and empirical research work, this can be extended to the major as well, with implications for other disciplines, and includes involvement and encouragement of research which is typically reserved from graduate students. We should follow student's leads in the evolution of writing, and crafts majors around making inroads into humanist inquiry. The writing major conceived in this way can be an important location of praxis, a place to see how the theoretical plays our in the world and in practice. Major ultimately helps us to define and expand the discipline of rhetoric and composition, and we should encourage undergrads to be involved in that process through active participation and labor. Inquiry, invention, discovery, and delivery can be at the core and interdisciplinary and public face of the major.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Research and aspirations of what the major could be. Has a useful way of directing the attention towards the role of undergraduates in these developed and developing majors, and highlights the significant role that they can and do play.
