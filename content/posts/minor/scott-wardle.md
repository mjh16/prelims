## One Liner
Threshold concepts can serve as a reflective frame in the development, administration, and implementation of a writing major.

## Summary
Threshold concepts are able to powerfully and intentionally organize writing majors in the ways in which they stabilize and name ideas and concepts that are important to the discipline. While they did not consciously utilize threshold concepts in their development and revision of the department and the major, on reflection and analysis they had structured many of their moves and hires. Propose that the conscious use of threshold concepts, as an intentional frame, is a powerful want to think about how to create, administer, and grow both a writing departments and a writing major. This process and how it is implemented in majors/programs/departments expands back out into the discipline of rhetoric and composition and a whole.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Useful, both as a program profile and in a forward looking way. Provides good looks at what things are, how they unfolded, and what they could be.
