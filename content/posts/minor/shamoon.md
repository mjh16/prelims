## One Liner
Where does creative nonfiction live in a professionally or discipline focused writing major?

## Summary
Where does creative nonfiction fit within the major? They suggest focusing on theoretical and conceptual issues as a field and a discipline. That unless we can define, as a discipline, theoretical and conceptual connections between creative nonfiction and rhetoric and composition this is an area for a potential schism now or in the future between the two.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
I think that this also extends to creative writing, especially as they have become more aware of and invested in pedagogy, and pedagogical disruptions. I think that there is a lot of potential in at least exploring what some common causes and spaces might be.
