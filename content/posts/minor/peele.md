## One Liner
Major/concentrations create and solidify a definition of what writing is.

## Summary
That in stabilizing a definition of writing for many different contexts is useful, but also stretches the limits of disciplinarity. Notes how change is slow within institutional structures and large fields/disciplines. Brings to attention issues of what writing is and what its relationship to rhetoric and composition. Also brings into question the role of creative writing. Issues of academic turf.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Might be a useful piece, short, as an example.
