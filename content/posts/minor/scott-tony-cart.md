## One Liner
Marxist and labor based analysis of the major and the discipline that encourages a deeper understanding of the connections between what we do in the writing classroom and the institutional means by which it is done.

## Summary
"Writing majors will need to be developed mindful of how current instituional practices already shape the ongoing concerns and work of the field" (88). Tony Scott argues that by examining the curriculum of writing classrooms, and then writing majors, we can examine how the material relations of power that exist through the classroom. Jt allows us to be mindful of the relationships between capital and labor as it exists within the institutional contexts of writing classrooms at universities. Uses the frame of marxist circulation to map the socio-economic relationships and exchanges that occur. The major can and should be transformative not only for students, but also for society. It allows us to see and teach, through circulation, the ecological network of interactions as they exists culturally and institutionally. Uses activity theroy to map out and frame the work of the major. Argues that we can use new majors to change ecologies of post-structuralist writing and literacy, and address social and economic issues while doing so.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Activity theory shows up again! Also, useful in thinking about the broader work that writing majors can do, and the way in which we, as departments and a field, conceive of the labor that goes into and comes out of a major. Useful in thinking about issues of labor and practice beyond FYC and into other areas of concerns for rhetoric and composition. Very useful in critiquing the exploitive past of FYC and how we can move beyond it. Also, really useful in mapping relationships between institutions and the work of the major.
