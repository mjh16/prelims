## One Liner
Using surveys and document collection, provide a snapshot of the undergraduate writing major around 2010.

## Summary
Responding to the CCC's committee on the major, they outline the growth of the undergraduate writing major. They map the growth of the major in English departments and independent writing departments as a valuable and growing set of work being done by Rhetoric and Composition. They find that there are two main types of writing majors: liberal arts writing and professional/rhetorical writing. They find commonalities in these two groupings of majors, and generalized trends in each of the types.

### Liberal Arts Writing Majors Traits

- Many literature, creative writing, and literary theory courses
- Many look like a literature major with a writing component attached or prescribed as an afterthought
  - Course Rationale hard to determine
  - No learning outcomes evident across the curriculum

### Professional/Rhetorical Traits

- Writing focused, dominated by writing course
- Focus on technology and production

### Common Difficulties and Development

- Much of the disorganization (lack of focus) seems to be due to the way in which they arose
  - Compromise due to institution or department
  - Resistance that a writing major comes at the expense of literature
- Conflict of ethos of liberal arts vs. the practical skills nature
- Popularity, staffing, and local politics (department)
  - Composition viewed as a second class citizen, a service that English does for the university
- Many find it difficult, especially outside of English, to see the discipline of rhetoric and composition as doing anything other than offering service courses.

### What should it look like? Driven by 3 question

1. What Should Our Gateway Course Be? (425)
  - Few have one, what should they be?
2. What Should Our Major Include in Terms of History, Theory, and Research? (426)
  - History of rhetoric - not many.
3. What Should Our Capstone Course Be? (428)
  - Many examples as models: Internship, portfolio, thesis, etc

### Consensus and Recommendations

1. Named something with writing in the name - more representative to a broader community of what it is and does
2. Include research methods
3. Encourage double major - allow for interdisciplinary development of writing
4. What are the outcomes?

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Snapshot of a coalescing of what a major is or could be. EWM fits many of these well. Also offers useful synthesis of what it is and what it could be, along with making concrete ties into rhetoric and composition as a discipline. Useful as a piece that surveys current status with some indications of what it could be.
