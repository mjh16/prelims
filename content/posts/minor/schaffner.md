## One Liner
Proposes a socio-epistemic approach for the major that pushes towards an abandonment of the double-consciousness that separates learning about writing from the activity of writing.

## Summary
In this approach the major helps to push students, administrators, teachers, and institutions to abandon the double-consciousness that separates the learning about writing from the activity of writing. Major focus and work helps students to become specialists in the study of written language, rhetoric, writing technologies, and image/textual semiotics.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Found this curriculum rather generous.
