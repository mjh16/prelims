## One Liner
Driven by local context as a commuter campus with a focus on balancing theory, practice, and ethics while developing skills as effective and employable writers.

## Summary
The BA at Penn State Berks combines the ethics and focus of the liberal arts with the practical skills and experiences for writers in professional environments. Over the twelve year history of the program, there have been a number changing contextual demands, and a feature of the development of the major has been a positive instability, fluidity, and adaptability as features of the program. There have been struggles with balancing the role of the major with its location within the English department.

The major itself developed in phases:

1. Developed the curriculum with an ethical and political mission
  - Blend theory and practice
  - rhetorical and practical focus in tension
  - Capstone with an internship and portfolios
  - extra curriculars developed as well
2. Negotiations and adaptations
  - Found that there was a need for more skill development and technical experience
  - Reduced the required rhetoric classes from 3 to 2 to add student adaptability and flexibility
3. Designing and Redesigning the program
  - Has been assessment driven through alumni surveys
  - Used to direct the changes in the program and the offerings
  - Developed a gateway course
  - Developed a senior level editing course
  - Eliminated the literature requirements within the major

A writing major requires ongoing renegotiation, reflection, assessment, and revision to address the needs of students and the localized context.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Useful piece in thinking about the development of a program, and the need for revisions to that program. It is also useful in thinking about majors and programs as alive and ongoing. That adaptability, flexibility, and revisions are features, not bugs, of the system. Need to be open to this change. Also highlights the importance of work outside the major itself in its life.
