## One Liner
Traces the development of advanced composition through the growth of composition and American Universities in the 20th century.

## Summary
Adams and Adams trace the development and growth of advanced composition in the introduction to the collection, *Teaching Advanced Composition: Why and How.* This trace works to define advanced composition within American universities through the 20th century. Has a focus on advanced composition as a Rhetoric and Composition area of interest and focus, and they work to situate it as something different and necessary within English departments and programs. Also differentiate it from WAC/WID programs and technical and professional writing/communication classes. They examine majors, minors, focuses, and indications/descriptions of Advanced Composition in historical tracing. They trace a timeline of rhetoric and composition teaching and instruction in the US, starting with a focus on stylistic rhetoric pre-reconstruction -> rhetoric and belles lettres -> only freshman composition -> advanced electives (exposition especially), -> development of journalism, creative writing, and technical writing out of these contexts -> CCCCs troubles in define advanced composition in the 80s.

They then position the edited collection as an exploration of what advanced composition is and proposes it's relationship to Rhetoric and composition. They differentiate advanced composition as different from WAC programs, and situated within the disciplinary context of rhetoric and composition, including its existence within English departments. They also situate some aspirations of advanced composition, largely from Fulkerson and M.H. Abrams. Focus on the ideas of artist, audience, work, or universal as themes in the chapters, with advanced composition offering theory, practice, and reading/writing approaches useful for these classes.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Situates the development of Advanced Composition as something important and different from the work that has been done in Rhetoric and composition. Also, useful in introducing/summarizing what advanced composition is. A useful moment for where talk about a major came from, why it has gain importance.
