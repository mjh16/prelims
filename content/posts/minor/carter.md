## One Liner
Proposes a theory of expertise in writing as a organizational theory for advanced composition.

## Summary
This article seeks to define and explore a theory of expertise as an organizing theory for advanced composition as something that is distinct and different from First-Year Composition. Sees advanced composition as potentially and ideally offering something more than just more of the same with FYC. Defines expertise as a movement from behavior that is governed by general principles, processes, and strategies, to behavior that is governed by specialized knowledge. This is characterized by a move from global writing strategies to sophisticated knowledge of specific and specialized rhetorical situations. Carter examines general and specific knowledge, tracing the move of expertise from general into domain knowledge. Proposes that advanced composition should follow a theory of expertise that can illustrate how advanced comp is different not just in form but also in kind through its explorations of discipline specific knowledge and practice. He is able to illustrate many of the ways in which advanced composition is different from first-year composition, and in how it is developmentally related to it. Since expertise is discipline specific, advanced composition classes should be within those contexts to be most effective.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
The theory of expertise sounds useful, if a bit unsupported by ongoing research. Provides a useful synthesis of where and what it is and could be. Also, has some useful ties in making it distinct from wac/wid programs, but how advanced composition course could fit within those curricular and discipline specific contexts, with support and theory to help situated it.
