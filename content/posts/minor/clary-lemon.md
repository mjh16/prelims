## Summary
Major is a driver of 'why' to be excited about rhetoric and composition. Moved to Canada for the major. Helps to forge new potentials across contexts for rhetoric and composition. The major also brings attention to the enthocentricism of rhetoric and composition as it is a deeply and distinctly American program.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Reflection and connection piece. Interesting to think of in response to others and as an example in itself
