## One Liner
Theorizes a progressive writing major from the experiences of a major at an HBCU in the Washington DC metro area.

## Summary
Through a focus on the curriculum and experiences within a Writing Major at an urban HBCU in Washington DC, argues that as curriculum theorists, designers, and conscious pedagogue that we should pay attention to the "gritty materialities of the places our students inhabit and come from" (100). Uses this unique temporal and material space to argue for a responsible and appropriate approach to the major that (re)claim patterns and practices of language use in academic and nonacademic contexts. The major can be a conscious and aware (a woke?) space for cultural critique and social activism through intentional and ongoing awareness of the spaces that the major produces and reproduces. Uses haptic and optic frames from Deleuze in the analysis (what you feel and what you see) to question issues and evaluations of power and privilege. While the major at any one context, and especially at this HBCU's context, may look the same to an outside observer (optic) it necessarily needs to feel different (haptic) in response to the times and places that it exists in.

Makes following recommendations:

- Curricular designers need to reflect reality, in context, and provide tools for students to access their most immediate environments.
- Context-specific major
- Emergent forms
- Curriculum as cartographic - traces, names, and responds to the existing landscape and the ways its being used.
  - Also, provides the tools, definitions, and literacies to navigate
These are especially important at HBCU's with their already class and race conscious mission and social justice mandate

A major should: mix content and practice, make better spaces and places, look for ways to pursue economic and social justice.

## Uses, Thoughts, and Connections
Recommendations for local contexts alongside useful framing for social justice applications. Might this of this as exposing a "woke" curriculum in contemporary understandings.
